The Wealth Tax Officer included a sum of Rs. 1,50,000 representing accrued interest on the assessee 's money lending investments in the net wealth of the assessee. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner deleted the additions of Rs. 1,50,000. The Commissioner of Wealth Tax applied under sub section (1) of section 27 of the Wealth Tax Act for a reference of the cases to this Court. The question is whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Wealth Tax Officer was in law justified in including in the net wealth of the assessee interest due on accrual basis (though not realised) on the outstandings of the money lending business, the accounts of the assessee being maintained on cash basis. The question was decided in favour of the Revenue. The assessee appealed to the Appellate Tribunal and contended that as it maintained its books of account in accordance with the cash system of accounting the accrued interest on the money lending investments could not be included in the wealth tax assessments. The Appellate Tribunal observed that the judgment of the Orissa High Court was binding on it, and accordingly by a consolidated order dated April 3, 1972, it dismissed the appeals. The Commissioner of Wealth Tax applied under sub section (1) of section 27 of the Wealth Tax Act for a reference of the cases to this Court. The question was decided in favour of the Revenue.

The Union of India has preferred the Civil Appeal No. 1709 of 1988. Parma Nanda seeking a complete exoneration from the charge has preferred the SLP No. 6998 of 1988. The question which has to be decided, therefore, is whether the Tribunal has power to modify the penalty awarded by the Competent authority on the ground that it is excessive or disproportionate to the misconduct proved? The answer to the question cannot be determined without reference to the scope of judicial review in the pre Tribunal period. It is also necessary to remember the purpose for which the Tribunal came to be established. Before the Tribunal was constituted, the Courts were exercising judicial review of administrative decisions in public services. This judicial review was sought to be taken away by the Constitution (42nd Amendment Act, 1976). By this amendment, Articles 323A and 323B were introduced in the Constitution, thereby opening altogether a new chapter in our Administrative law. Article 323A(1) which is relevant for our purpose is confined to matters relating to the public services. It provides power to Parliament to enact law for establishment of Administrative Tribunals for adjudication of disputes with regard to service matters. The service matters are of persons appointed to the public service and posts. The public service and posts may be in connection with the affairs of the union or of any State. The law to be enacted by Parliament may also cover persons appointed in the local or other authority or of any corporation owned or controlled by the Government. There should be only one Tribunal for the Union of India and one for each State or for two or more States put together. The law cannot provide for hierarchy of Tribunals. In pursuance of Articles 323A(1) the Parliament enacted the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985 (\"The Act\"). We may briefly examine the statutory framework. Section 4 of the Act provides for establishment of Central Administrative Tribunal as well as State Administrative Tribunal. It also provides power to constitute Benches of the Central Administrative Tribunal. Sections 5 to 11 deal with the composition of Tribunals and Benches thereof and terms of office of the Chairman, Vice Chairman and other members thereof. Section 14 provides powers and authority to"

The appellant claimed that Lakshmamma was entitled to make a will in respect of her half share in the properties in suit and that the will was genuine and valid. Respondent I, the sole heir of Lakshmamma, resisted the appellant 's claim and alleged that Lakshmamma was not competent to make a will in respect of any of the properties in suit. She also alleged that the will was not genuine and valid and that it had been brought into existence through the machinations of the appellant. The learned trial judge held that the will was genuine and valid and that the rule of survivorship applied to the properties conveyed by the said will. He also held that the rule of survivorship did not apply to the properties purchased by Sadagopalachar, Lakshmamma 's husband, out of the joint income from the properties bequeathed to him and his wife by Annaji lyengar. The learned judge held that the properties purchased by Sadagopalachar were purchased out of the income of the properties of his father and of his mother. He also held that the suit was maintainable, was not barred by time and had been properly filed. In the result, the learned judge declared that Lakshmamma was the full owner of half the share in the properties in suit and that respondent I under the will had only a life interest in respect of the said half share in items 1 and 2.

The High Court referred to the fact that the appellants had not produced their account books to show that they had been purchased by persons other than those who ran cinemas or for any other use. Of course, it is very difficult to identify a taxable commodity merely by the use to which it may be put. Nevertheless, it appears that the entry under consideration links the taxable object with its general or ordinary use. The taxing authorities were, therefore, compelled to consider the use which is generally made of the arc carbons. They had concluded that the common or ordinary use of the arc carbons was that they exuded their power foul light cast, through the projectors, on cinema screens. It was pointed out that the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal, the final departmental authority under the Act, had allowed an application for adducing expert evidence to determine the question whether arc carbons manufactured by the appellant company could be covered by the entry under consideration. It, however, appears that, before further evidence could be taken, at the appellate stage, on the subject, a decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, in the State of Andhra Pradesh vs Srimathi Nidmarthi Saraswathi Devi(1), was brought to the notice of the Tribunal. There, the High Court had held that such arc carbons are covered by the 4th entry in the 1st Schedule of the Madras General Sales Tax Act. Hence, the Tribunal dismissed the appeal without taking further evidence. In the High Court, two decisions cited on behalf of the appellants were: Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Madhurai Division, Madhurai vs Ravi Auto Stores(2), and State of Madras vs Indian oxygen Ltd.

The High Court pointed out that in both these cases what was decided was whether \"welding electrodes\", considered by themselves, were \"electrical goods\" falling within entry 41 of Schedule 1 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act.

The appellant was elected as a trustee by the Sengunatha Mudaliars of Manjakollai village at a meeting held on June 27, 1957. According to the appellant the temple was rounded two hundred years ago by the members of his community and since then the management of the temple and its affairs was always vested in the community of the Sengunatha Mudaliars and no person other than the elected trustee had at any time the right of management and control of the temple. The respondents, however, took a different view and proceeded on the basis that trusteeship of the Kumaran Koil was not hereditary. The Subordinate Judge held that the appellant was a hereditary trustee and the suit was not barred by limitation. The respondents took the matter in appeal to the Madras High Court which by its judgment dated March 31, 1965 allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Subordinate Judge. Section 6, sub section (9) of Madras Act 1 of 1925 states: \"In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context (9) 'hereditary trustee ' means the trustee of a religious institution succession to whose office devolves by hereditary right or is regulated by usage or is specifically provided for by the founder, so long as such scheme of succession is in force;\" This Act has been substituted by Madras Act 22 of 1959 but the definition of the trustee is identical in both the Acts. The question to be considered in this appeal is whether the appellant is a hereditary trustee Within the meaning of the section. The definition includes three types of cases: (1) succession to the office of trusteeship devolving by hereditary right; (2) succession to such office being regulated by usage; and (3) succession being specifically provided for by the founder on condition that the scheme of such succession is still in force.

The High Court further observed: \"Poor PW 4 was compelled to speak to a version which ought to accord and harmonise with the version given out by PWs 1, 2 and 3\". Even so the High Court thought that it was justified in convicting the present accused on the sole testimony of PW 4 \"corroborated by the contents of exhibit P1 (FIR)\". The High Court held that \"PW 4 who was afflicted with the fell disease of leprosy has absolutely no motive to implicate the first accused\". The High Court further held that PW 4 gave a \"candid, natural and truthful version at the earliest opportunity\". The High Court has taken note of the fact that \"there has been a history of a bitter feud spanning over nearly a decade between the first accused and his father on the one hand and the deceased Viswanatham on the other\". This is, therefore, a case where conviction of the accused depends on the sole testimony of a single witness. If the witness is absolutely reliable there can be no infirmity in convicting the accused. In that case even corroboration may not be sought for ordinarily in an appeal under article 136 of the Constitution we would have hesitated to go into the facts to reappreciate the evidence. It is, however, not possible to adopt that course in this case where the testimony of the sole witness has been rejected with reference to the second accused who was on the same boat with the appellant. The very fact that this eye witness could be persuaded to substitute PWs 1, 2 and 3 for his deceased brother as chasing the assailants, degrades him from the status of an absolutely reliable witness. This witness may not have a qualm of conscience in implicating the accused for the mere asking by someone, if not by the inimical police officer (PW 23) against whom criminal cases were pending at the instance of the accused 's father. Apart from that we find that the High Court has not considered the intrinsic quality of the evidence of PW 4. It failed to notice certain broad facts which should definitely weigh with the court while appreciating ocular testimony."

The appellant has come up to this Court by special leave. Briefly stated the prosecution case is that when the house in which the appellant lives along with his father Diwan Singh, a retired Police Head Constable, was searched by the C.I.D. Inspector, S.N. Singh, along with Masood Murtaza, Sub Inspector of Police, Bulandshahr on May 12, 1956, in connection with a case against Messrs Greenwood Publicity, they accidentally discovered a large number of letters and postcards and also the five registered letters in question. At the time of the search the appellant who happens to be a trade union official, was not in Bulandshahr but was away on leave at Delhi in connection with a postal conference.

The High Court dismissed his appeal and confirmed the conviction and sentence. The appellant has appealed by special leave to this Court. The prosecution case, in brief, is that due to enmity, the appellant caused injuries to Sheo Sahai, who was sleeping in his cattle shed, with a sword at about mid night on the night between June 14 15, 1960. Sheo Sahai died of the injuries received. The appellant thereafter proceeded to the Canal Distributory at some distance from the village and had a bath there. Later on, he went to the Police Station, Ekdil, nine miles away and lodged a report. He delivered the sword which has been found by the Serologist to be stained with human blood. The appellant was taken in custody and as a result of the investigation was sent up for trial. The appellant denied the allegation that he had caused the death of Sheo Sahai and alleged that he was falsely accused of the offence. He also denied the other allegations for the prosecution. He alleged that one Paley Singh informed him about the murder of Sheo Sahai and asked him to go to the Police Station, Ekdil, and to inform the Station Officer orally about the murder. He did accordingly. He was detained at the Police Station till 11 a.m., the next day and was then put up in the lock up. The Sub Inspector took his thumb impression forcibly on three papers, but did not tell him the reason. The appellant adduced no evidence in support of his statement. The Courts below rightly did not accept his version. The evidence led by the prosecution consisted of the evidence relating to motive, to his extrajudicial confession to one Ujagar Singh when he was having a bath in the Canal, to his purchasing the sword and to his delivering it at the police Station after he had dictated the report. Both the Courts below rightly believed the evidence about the motive and the purchase of the sword by the appellant. The learned Sessions Judge believed Ujagar Singh and acted on the extra judicial confession made by the appellant to him. The High Court, however, did not rely on this extra judicial confession. It relied on certain statements made by the appellant in his report dictated at the Police Station and considered those facts together with the motive and the evidence about the purchase of the sword sufficient to confirm the appellant 's conviction and sentence."

The High Court dismissed the petition holding that the petitioners were not entitled to any relief as they had approached the Court after undue delay. The question whether the petitioners were entitled to any relief is a question of law and we shall first examine whether the High Court was right in holding that the petitioners were not entitled to any relief on account of the inordinate delay involved in the presentation of the writ petition. The Collector published the notice under Rule 4(1) of the Rules on September 30, 1978 and also called upon interested persons to prefer claims and/or objections thereto within a period of 20 days. In paragraph 7 of the notice, it was mentioned that claims and objections received beyond the prescribed period would not be considered. The period prescribed for preferring claims and objections under Rule 4(3) was 30 days. It is not the case of the petitioners that they did not know immediately after the publication of such notice that in the said notice a period of 20 days had been mentioned in its preamble as the period within which the claims and objections could be preferred and in paragraph 7 thereof it had been stated that any such claim or objection filed beyond the prescribed period was liable to be rejected. If they felt that the said notice suffered from any illegality, they could have brought it to the notice of the Collector immediately thereafter. It was open to them to move the State Government under Rule 6 of the Rules to make an order directing the Collector to follow the provisions governing the preparation of the electoral roll. It was also open to them to file a writ petition immediately after the publication of the said notice questioning its legality. None of the above courses was adopted by the petitioners. Persons whose claims were rejected could have filed an appeal under Rule 5 before the Collector. No such appeal was presented. The final electoral roll was published on November 16, 1978. The petitioners filed the writ petition on December 28, 1978. The petitioners were not prompt in moving the High Court. The High Court held that the petitioners were not entitled to any relief"

An industrial dispute between these workmen and the management of Orient Paper Mills Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"the Company\") was referred by the State Government under section 10(1) (d) of the Industrial Disputes Act (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\") for adjudication by the Tribunal enumerating 30 different items of dispute. The Tribunal gave its award on all the thirty items. The special leave in this Court was sought and granted in respect of two matters covering some of these items. The first matter related to fixation of wages, including minimum wages, and this was covered by items Nos. 1, 3, 4, 22 and 26 in the Schedule attached to the Order of Reference. The second matter in the appeal related to bonus covered by item No. 2 of that Schedule. In the course of the hearing of the appeal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the workmen further gave up some of the points which were the subject matter of the items mentioned above, so that in this judgment we need deal with only those points which were argued by him in support of the appeal. The first and the main point argued with regard to wages was that the Tribunal, after holding that there was no identical industry in this region comparable with the Company, came to the view that there were other industries in the region in which minimum wages were higher than the minimum wages paid by the Company, but failed to fix the minimum wages in the award in accordance with the minimum wages being paid in those industries. Instead, what the Tribunal did was to work out the minimum wages, which should be paid, on an entirely different basis. It was also urged in the alternative that, even in adopting the latter course, the Tribunal committed an error inasmuch as, in making the calculation, the Tribunal only tried to neutralise about 36 per cent of the cost of living on the basis of the rise in Price Index instead of permitting neutralisation to the extent of at least 90%, which could have been done when fixing the minimum wages for the lowest class of workmen. The principle for fixation of minimum wages that should ordinarily be adopted was laid down by this Court in the case of French Motor Car Co. Limited vs Workmen(1) where it was held: \"It is now well settled that the principle of industry cum region has to be applied by an Industrial"

It also started a business of manufacture and sale of umbrellas sometime about 1932 and another business of manufacture and sale of soap sometime about 1932. The firm was constituted by an agreement of partnership dated December 6, 1918. On January 2, 1934, the remaining four partners executed an instrument varying some of the terms of the agreement of December 6, 1918. On April 27, 1934, Purusbotham died and the firm was left with three partners, namely, Nagjee, Narayanjee and Maneklal. On May 30, 1939, two instruments, annexure C I and C II, were executed between Nagjee, Narayanjee and Maneklal and Hemchand and the other partners respectively. The appellant contends that these instruments did not really create new partnerships dissolving the existing one. It contends that under annexure C I an outsider Hemchand was admitted as partner in some of the businesses of the existing partnership, namely, the umbrella and soap businesses and by the other instrument, annexure C II, the other existing businesses of that partnership, e.g., in yarn, piece goods, money lending etc., were, continued by the subsisting partners mentioned above. The respondent, on the other hand, contends that these two instruments show that the business of the existing firm had been split up into two and transferred to two different owners, namely, two newly constituted firms with different partners, some of whom were no doubt common, and this amounted to a discontinuance of the existing firm. The question for determination is whether the appellant was entitled to relief under section 25(4) of the Income tax Act, 1922.

Two things become necessary to determine for the purpose of giving relief to the plaintiff. One, her share in her husband 's share and two, her husband 's own share in the coparcenary property. The proviso to section 6 contains the formula for fixing the share of the claimant while Explanation 1 contains a formula for deducing the share of the deceased. The plaintiff 's share, by the application of the proviso, has to be determined according to the terms of the testamentary instrument, if any, made by the deceased and since there is none in the instant case, by the application of the rules of intestate succession contained in sections 8, 9 and 10 of the Hindu Succession Act. The deceased Khandappa died leaving behind him two sons, three daughters and a widow. The son, daughter and a widow are mentioned as heirs in class I of the Schedule and therefore, by reason of the provisions of section 8(a) read with the 1st clause of section 9, they take simultaneously and to the exclusion of other heirs. As between them the two sons, the three daughters and the widow will take equally, each having one share in the deceased 's property under section 10 read with Rules 1 and 2 of that section. Thus, whatever be the share of the deceased in the coparcenary property, since there are six sharers in that property each having an equal share, the plaintiff 's share therein will be 1/6th. The next step, equally important though not equally easy to work out, is to find out the share which the deceased had in the coparcenary property because after all, the plaintiff has a 1/6th interest in that share. Explanation 1 which contains the formula for determining the share of the deceased creates a fiction by providing that the interest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to be the share in the property that would have been allotted to him if a partition of the property had taken place immediately before his death, irrespective of whether he was entitled to claim partition or not. The question is whether the share of the deceased in the coparcenary property is to be determined by the rules of intestate succession or by the rules"

By a Treaty between the East India Company Nawab Asfuddaula in or about the year 1775, the province of Benaras was ceded to the British Government. The British Government granted a sanad of Raj to Raja Chet Singh who in turn gave the Jagir of Parganas Seyedpore and Bhittery in perpetuity to Babu Ausan Singh. It appears that in 1796 there were some disputes between Babu Ausan Singh and the Zamindars in the district and the matter was referred by the Collector of Benaras to the Board of Revenue in Calcutta. The disputes between the Jagirdars and Zamindars ultimately ended in 1837 by a compromise between the British Government and the then Jagirdar Hat Narain Singh whereby the British Government granted a pension of Rs. 36,322/8/ to Babu Hat Narain Singh and his heirs in perpetuity. The quantum of this pension was calculated on the basis of 1/4th of the revenue of the Jagir.

By section 24 of the Amending Act 47 of 1978, a proviso to section 63(7) was introduced. The proviso to section 63(7) is as follows: \"(7) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub section (1) but subject to any rules that may be made under this Act, any State Transport Authority may, for the purpose of promoting tourism, grant permits valid for the whole or any part of India, in respect of such number of tourist vehicles as the Central Government may, in respect of that State, specify in this behalf, and the provisions of Sections 49, 50, 51, 57, 58, 59, 59 A, 60, 61 and 64 shall, as far as may be, apply in relation to such permits: Provided that preference shall be given to applications for permits from (i) the India Tourism Development Corporation; (ii) a State Tourism Development Corporation; (iii) a State Tourist Department; (iv) such operators of tourist cars, or such travel agents, as may be approved in this behalf by the Ministry of the Central Government dealing in tourism. \" The State Transport Appellate Tribunal, by its order dated 28th February, 1985, set aside the grant of two permits in favour of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation, set aside the grant of three out of eleven permits to the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation and instead granted three permits to private operators and increased the number of permits granted to the Indian Tourism Development Corporation from one to three. The Tribunal took the view that having regard to the rule of preference enunciated by the proviso to section 63(7), the applications from the 'non preferred ' class had to be excluded as the number of applications from the applicants who were required to be given preference exceeded the number of permits to be granted. It was on that ground that the grant of two permits to the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation was set aside, though the Appellate Tribunal had no doubt regarding the resources and ability of that corporation to operate the tourist services.

The respondent purchased, by a registered instrument dated October 5, 1956, the business carried on by one Purushottam Raju under the name All India Trading Company. Purushottam Raju was the sole proprietor of the business and had been assessed to sales tax in respect of his turnover for the years 1948 49 and 1949 50. The assessee paid some amounts towards sales tax thus determined, but there remained some arrears of sales tax i.e., Rs. 3836 4 0 for 1948 49 and Rs. 1218 1 9 for 1949 50. The Sales tax authorities attempted to recover the arrears of tax from the respondent as the purchaser of the business. The respondent denied liability to pay sales tax but his contention was over ruled by the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer. The respondent appealed to the Commercial Tax Officer as well as to the Board of Revenue, but the appeals were dismissed. The respondent thereafter moved the Madras High Court under article 226 of the Constitution for the issue of a writ in the nature of certiorari to quash the orders of the Commercial Tax Officer and the Board of Revenue. Ganapatia Pillai, J. who heard the petition dismissed it. The respondent took the matter in appeal under the Letters Patent. The Division Bench consisting of section Ramachandra Iyer, C.J. and Ramakrishnan, J. reversed the judgment of the Single Judge, holding that Rule 21 A of the Sales Tax Rules was illegal and ultra vires and the respondent was not liable to pay the sales tax due from his predecessor in title, Purushottam Raju. This appeal is brought by special leave, from the judgment of the Division Bench of the Madras High Court dated September 13, 1963 in Writ Appeal No. 10 of 1962."

The appellant has suppressed the said plan and, therefore, in the circumstances, we are justified to draw an inference that, if produced, it would be against the appellant 's contention. From the aforesaid documentary evidence we hold, agreeing with the courts below, that the southern boundary of the appellant 's holding, which is conterminous with the northern boundary of the respondents ' holding, is the line between points A and B shown in exhibit 3(b). The next question addressed by the courts below is how to ascertain the point A. The argument of learned counsel for the appellant is that the map translated into words indicates that the correct boundary should be a line drawn from the true meeting point of the four villages Pandebera, Jharia Khas, Lodhna and Kujama at a bearing of 82.15 ', whereas the contention of the respondents is that the line actually drawn on the lease map correctly lays down the northern boundary of the respondents ' leasehold. It is settled law that a map referred to in a lease should be treated as incorporated in the lease and as forming part of the document: see Darapali Sadagar vs Najir Ahamed (1). As in this case the map is drawn to scale and incorporated in the lease deed, it is not permissible to ignore the starting point of the boundary line and adopt instead any scientific point based on survey. The Commissioner appointed by the court tested the position of the six trijunction pillars shown in the map of lease dated November 23, 1900, and found that two of the trijunction pillars were in their correct positions. On the basis of these two trijunction pillars, the Commissioner relaid, by the process of superimposition, the northern boundary line of the leasehold property. The point A in the map so laid does not tally with the point where the aforesaid four villages actually meet. He pointed out that the correct point where the said four villages met would be 1680 feet only from the trijunction pillar of Lodhna, Kujama and Madhuban, whereas the point A was at a distance of 1750 feet from the said trijunction pillar. But learned counsel for the appellant contends that according to exhibit 3 the western boundary should be according to the revenue plan and, therefore, point A should be fixed at a distance of 168"

The appellant contended that it was entitled to dispense with the services of any employee at any time by giving 14 days notice or paying 12 days wages. The Industrial Tribunal held that the action of the appellant was a colourable exercise of the power under r. 18(a) and set aside the order of discharge. The appellant applied for special leave which was granted. The main contention of the appellant was that it was entitled under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders to dispense with the services of any employee at any time by just giving 14 days notice or paying 12 days wages. We are of opinion that this claim of the appellant cannot be accepted. It is too late in the day for an employer to raise such a claim for it amounts to a claim \"to hire and fire\" an employee as the employer pleases and thus completely negatives security of service which has been secured to industrial employees through industrial adjudication for over a long period of time now. As far back as 1952, the Labour Appellate Tribunal had occasion to consider this matter relating to discharge by notice or in lieu thereof by payment of wages for a certain period without assigning any reason. It was of opinion that even in a case of this kind the requirement of bona fides is essential and if the termination of service is a colourable exercise of the power or as a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice the industrial tribunal would have the jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination. Further it held that where the termination of service is capricious, arbitrary or unnecessarily harsh on the part of the employer judged by normal standards of a reasonable man that may be cogent evidence of victimisation or unfair labour practice. These observations of the Labour Appellate Tribunal were approved by this Court in The Chartered Bank, Bombay vs The Chartered Bank Employees ' Union (1). and Assam Oil Company vs Its Workmen (2). Therefore if as in this case the employer wanted to take action for misconduct and then suddenly dropped the departmental proceedings which were intended to be held and decided to discharge the employee under r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders, it was clearly a colourable exercise of the power under that rule in as much as that rule was used to get rid of an employee instead of following the course of holding an inquiry for misconduct, notice for which"

The High Court observed that the jurisdiction of the Court of Small Causes to decide disputes between a tenant and his landlord and falling within the purview of section 28 of the Bombay Rent Control Act is derived from section 28 of the said Act, but at the same time if an issue is in fact barred by res judicata, then the Court has no jurisdiction on principles of res judicata to go into that question or to decide that question over again to the extent to which the Court, viz., the trial court in the instant case, proposed to go into that question and allow the whole question, that was closed once for all by consent decree of December 1, 1960, to be reopened, it is proposing to exercise the jurisdiction which is not vested in it by law.

The respondent filed a Writ Petition on the file of the High Court of Allahabad in Writ Petition No. 3164 of 1985. The High Court held that the order of termination that had been served on the respondent was an invalid one since it had been issued on the basis of Vigilance Report and no opportunity had been given to the respondent to show cause why such action should not be taken against him.

The discrepancies were in regard to which of them woke up first, where was the lantern and which of the neighbours came first to the scene on hearing their cries. The High Court was also right in holding that the medical evidence supported the prosecution version and not the defence version. Merely because the Medical Officer stated that the victim could have received the injury if she was standing, it did not follow that the injury could have been received in the circumstances mentioned by the accused. The injury was inflicted with great force and its direction was upward. The location of the injury was 6 cms. below the arm pit on the left side. According to the accused the deceased received the injury when she placed herself between P. W. 1 and himself. We do not think that an injury of the nature received by the deceased could have been caused in the manner suggested by the accused. The injury must have been caused in the manner suggested by the prosecution that is, when the deceased was lying on her right side. It is true that the accused did not have any deep motive to kill the deceased. It is obvious that he must have been upset by the persistent refusal of the brother and mother of the deceased to send her with him to his house. He probably attributed the refusal to reluctance on the part of his wife to accompany him straightaway. We may also refer here to the comment of the learned Counsel for the appellant that realising that the motive would assume considerable importance if the case was one based on circumstantial evidence, the prosecution tried to make P. W. 3 depose as if she had witnessed occurrence. We do not think that the comment is justified. P.W. 3, an old woman of 69 years, stated in her evidence that she saw the accused who was sitting by the side of the deceased on the cot make a gesture as if he was stabbing the deceased and that the deceased cried out 'Amma.

In view of this, no question was raised before the trial Magistrate or the High Court that the prosecution was bad for want of sanction. But after the disposal of the appeal by the High Court, it was discovered that, in fact, there was no order of the Government sanctioning the prosecution, and that the Chief Secretary had committed a mistake in sending the communication, Exhibit PX. The position, therefore, is that the prosecution which has resulted in the conviction of the appellant was initiated without any sanction under section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and if sanction under that section is necessary, as contended for by Mr. Sethi, then the entire proceedings including the conviction must be quashed. According to the respondent, however, the main charge against the appellant is under section 409, and no sanction is required for a prosecution under that section. The point for decision is whether sanction under section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is necessary for prosecuting the appellant under section 409. There has been considerable divergence of judicial opinion on the scope of section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The question has latterly been the subject of consideration by the highest Courts in this country, and by the Privy Council, and the position may now be taken to be fairly well settled.

Ordinarily the effect of an excepting or a qualifying proviso is to carve something out of the preceding enactment or to qualify something enacted therein which but for the proviso would be in it and such a proviso cannot be construed as enlarging the scope of an enactment when it can be fairly and properly construed without attributing to it that effect.

But it has been held that a section framed as a proviso to a preceding section may sometimes contain matter which is in substance a fresh enactment adding and not merely qualifying that which goes before. Rhondda Urban Council vs Taff Vale Railway (2). It was argued on behalf of the Revenue that this proviso falls in the second category and takes the present cases out of section 32(1) of the Travancore Act and imposes a liability to tax on the profits or gains arising in that State, disallowing a deduction of the losses in British India and in States other than Travancore State against profits made in Travancore State: Rhondda Urban Council vs Taff Vale Railway (1) and Harrison vs Ward (2). It may be mentioned that in the majority of cases decided in India the proviso to section 24(1) of the Indian Act has been construed in a manner contrary to the submissions made on behalf of the Revenue. In order to determine the true meaning of the words of the proviso it is necessary and convenient to refer to the scheme of the Indian Act which is admitted by the parties to be same as that of the Travancore Act. From 1922 to 1939 in order to be taxable income, profits and gains had to be received or had to accrue in British India. In 1939 the idea of 'total world income ' was introduced and the definition of 'total income ' was modified by the Indian Income tax (Amendment) Act (VII of 1939) which also made consequential changes in other sections of the Indian Act. Under section 2(15) of the Act total income ' was defined to mean the total amount of income, profits and gains computed in the manner laid down in that Act. The 'total world income ' was defined as including all income, profits and gains wherever accruing or arising except income to which the Act did not apply.

The dispute arose in the following manner. The respondent company, Shaw Wallace & Co., was incorporated in 1946 as a Private Limited Company and in 1947 it was converted into a Public Limited Company. The general practice of the company both at the Head Office and the Branch Offices appears to have been to retire its employees at the age of 55 though in certain cases the company in its discretion permitted an employee to continue beyond that age. In September, 1959 an agreement was entered into between the company and its employees at Calcutta under which the age of retirement was extended to 58 years subject to the employees passing a medical examination on reaching the age of 55. Shortly after this the company 's employees at Bombay raised a dispute regarding their retirement age. They claimed that no workman should be retired from service before he had completed 60 years of age. This dispute was ultimately referred to the Industrial Tribunal, Maharashtra. Before the Tribunal the company resisted the workmen 's claim but submitted that it was agreeable to introduce for its Bombay employees provisions similar to those which had been introduced by agreement for the Calcutta employees retirement at the age of 58 subject to the employee passing a medical examination on reaching the age of 55. The Tribunal has directed that the age of retirement should be 58 but the company may in its discretion and with the express or implied consent of the employee concerned continue an employee after he attains that age. It is against this decision that the present appeal has been filed by the workmen. 429 The main question before us is whether the age of retirement of employees in the respondent company should be fixed at 58 years or at 60 years.

Thereafter six carts left for Mudgal at about 10 p.m. When the carts reached a Nala called Heri Halla about three miles from Lingsugar at about 11 30 p.m., 20 persons are said to have approached the carts and pelted stones. It was a dark night and the assailants were not identified. It appears that four out of the six carts escaped, but two carts were looted. The police investigated the case and arrested the 20 persons who were accused in the case as being the culprits involved in this incident. It is not necessary to go into rest of the case or the evidence on which the case of dacoity was established, because dacoity as such is not challenged before us. The accused were convicted on the sole evidence of having in their possession pieces of cloth which were later identified to belong to the traders. Searches took place between July 30, 1962 and August 17, 1962. In these searches cloth which was undoubtedly stolen at the time of the dacoity was found in their houses. The High Court, and the Court below drew from this the conclusion that the appellants were themselves the dacoits, and convicted them accordingly under section 395 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced them to 5 years ' rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 1000/ .

The environmental question has assumed proportions affecting all humanity. Industrialisation, urbanisation, explosion of population, overexploitation of resources, depletion of traditional sources of energy and raw materials and the search for new sources of energy and raw materials, the disruption of natural ecological balances, the destruction of a multitude of animal and plant species for economic reasons and sometimes for no good reason at all are factors which have contributed to environmental deterioration. While the scientific and technological progress of man has invested him with immense power over nature, it has also resulted in the unthinking use of the power, encroaching endlessly on nature. If man is able to transform deserts into cities, he is also leaving behind deserts in the place of cities. In the last century, a great German materialist philosopher warned mankind: \"Let us not, however, flatter ourselves overmuch on account of our human victories over nature. For each such victory nature takes its revenge on us. Each victory, it is true, in the first place brings about the results we expected, but in the second and third places it has quite different, unforeseen effects which only too often cancel the first. \" Ecologists are of the opinion that the most important ecological and social problem is the wide spread disappearance all over the world of certain species of living organisms. Biologists forecast the extinction of animal and plant species on a scale that is incomparably greater than their extinction over the course of millions of years. It is said that over half the species which became extinct over the last 2,000 years did so after 1900. The International Association for the Protection of Nature and Natural Resources calculates that now, on an average, one species or sub species is lost every year. It is said that approximately 1,000 bird and animal species are facing extinction at present. So it is that the environmental question has become urgent and it has to be properly understood and squarely met by man. Nature and history, it has been said, are two component parts of the environment in which we live, move and prove ourselves. The question of environmental protection is, therefore, a question of the survival of man and the survival of the environment.

The argument was raised in the Tribunal, but was rejected. A similar question arose for consideration by this Court in Technological Institute of Textiles vs Its Workmen and others(1) and it was held as follows with specific reference to the first proviso to section 49 of the Act according to which a person qualified to claim sickness benefit is not entitled to the benefit for an initial waiting period of two days except in the case of a spell of sickness following at an interval of not more than fifteen days, the spell of sickness for which benefit was last paid. It is apparent that the Employees ' State Insurance Scheme does not cover all contingencies of sickness and in any event the first two waiting days are not covered. In our opinion, the tribunal was, there fore, justified in its view that the workmen are entitled to 7 days ' sick leave with wages on production of a medical certificate. (1) [1965] 2 L.L.R. 3149. 85 It would thus appear that the Scheme of the benefits admissible under the Act cannot be said to cover the workmen 's demand for sick leave to the extent allowed by the Tribunal. Section 61 of the Act cannot thus be said to be applicable for the simple reason that the benefits granted by the Tribunal are not similar to those admissible under the Act. The Act does not in fact deal with the question of sickness leave. The other question regarding the adequacy of the sickness benefit under the provisions of the Act has been examined by the Tribunal with reference to the reports of the National Commission of Labour, 1969, the Labour Laws Review Committee and the Norms Committee of Gujarat State, which go to show that the benefit cannot be said to be adequate for, it works out to about half the average wage of a workman, and even that amount is not admissible for the first two days of sickness except in the case of a spell of sickness following, at an interval of not more than 15 days, the spell of sickness for which the sickness benefit was last paid. It has to be appreciated that a workman is entitled to sick leave for a period of 7 days with full pay and dearness"

It was passed for the ulterior purpose of preventing his freedom of speech and freedom of professional activity in the sphere of Goan affairs by reason of his known views in this behalf. (2) The detaining authority, in exercising its power, failed to apply its mind to the existence or otherwise of the legitimate objects of detention. The grounds of detention are vague. (3) The claim of State that no particulars of the grounds could be furnished in public interest is unsustainable and in any case mala fide. The last two have been urged with great insistence. We have been taken elaborately into what is claimed to be the relevant previous background of events. This part of the argument raises, what ultimately are questions of fact which have been fully considered by the High Court. It is, therefore, enough to state, in its broad outlines, the background, which is alleged as follows: (1)(a) There was a sudden search by the police on the 24th August, 1954, at the appellant 's place for alleged possession of illicit liquor. which, in fact, was not found. But under the guise thereof the police seized and carried away a mass of documents, papers and printed material of the appellant as also a typewriter belonging to him. (b) On the same day, a search was carried out by the police also at his residence at Mahim but nothing was found. (c) Immediately following the searches, the appellant was taken into illegal police custody and interrogated, and physically assaulted, and threatened. The above high handed action of the police, by way of search and seizure, was the subject matter of challenge by the appellant by means of a writ application in the High Court in which the police officers concerned filed affidavits virtually admitting the appellant 's allegations relating to seizure of papers, etc. The State itself could not support the said highhandedness.

The facts leading to the removal of the respondent from service are as follows: On April 4, 1958, it was alleged that the respondent, while attached to the Army Ordnance Corps Training Centre, Secundrabad, committed acts of gross misconduct. The allegations were as follows: \"Knowing Kumari Prakash as the daughter of a brother officer, Rao assisted her in going away from her parents protection and planning to run away with a sepoy. \" \"Rao, by threatening to cause harm to Kumari Prakash 's parents, intimidated her to visit his house where he took her in his scooter to the unit lines of 51 1 1 Gurkha Rifles where he arranged her meeting with a sepoy of the unit. \" \"He (i.e. Rao) acquiesced in the girl being met by the sepoy later at a tea shop nearby where she received a present of a sari and blouse from the sepoy in his presence. \" \"Rao then took Kumari Prakash to a hotel Saidya Lodge in Hyderabad and got a room to themselves by impersonating and giving a false identity as \"Mr. & Mrs. Prakash\". An inquiry into the matter was made by Court of Inquiry. The Chief of the Army Staff, after going through the proceedings of the Court of Inquiry, considered that the conduct of Capt. Rao was most unbecoming of an officer. As he was of opinion that trial of the officer by a General Court Martial was inexpedient, he ordered administrative action to be taken under r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954. By memorandum dated September 4, 1958, Rao was called upon to submit his explanation by way of defence regarding the allegations against him. The explanation of Rao was placed before the Central Government. The Central Government found it to be unsatisfactory, and on April 9, 1959, an order was passed removing the respondent from service.

The High Court dismissed the applications. The appellants have filed these appeals against the order of the High Court. The appellants contend that the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder constitute an unreasonable restriction upon their fundamental right to do business and that they not only do not achieve the object for which they are enacted but defeat their purpose. The object of the Act is to provide for the better regulation of the buying and selling of commercial crops in the State of Madras and for that purpose to establish markets and make Rules for their proper administration. The Act was passed in 1933 and the Rules were framed in 1934. The Act was amended in 1947 and 1951. The Act was extended to Ramanathapuram and Tirunelveli Districts in 1951 and to Virudhunagar, Rajapalayan and Sattur in Ramanathapuram District in 1952. The Act was further amended in 1953. The Act and the Rules were challenged in the High Court on the ground that they were unreasonable restrictions upon the appellants ' fundamental right to do business.

On 7 12 1950, about 3 o 'clock in the afternoon, Ramchander Shelke (the deceased) went to his field known as \"Bhavara\" with his wife 's sister Rasika Bai (P.W.1) and his servant Subhana Rao (P.W.7). Rasika Bai started to pick chillies in the field while Ramehander went to another field \"Vaniya che seth\" which is about a furlong away. We gather that this field is near a river called Papana. Anyway, Rasika Bai heard shouts from that direction, so she ran to the river bank with Subhana and they both say that they saw all five accused attacking Ramchander with axes and sticks. Two other persons, Laxman (P.W.6) and Elba (P.W.5), who were in the neighbourhood, also heard the cries and ran to the spot. They also say they witnessed the assault and name all five accused. The former has a field near by and was working in it; the latter was a passer by. Rasika Bai shouted out to the assailants not to beat Ramchander but they threatened her and then ran away. Ramehander died on the spot almost immediately. There are four eye witnesses, and the main question we have to consider is whether they can be believed. Ordinarily, we would not have enquired into questions of fact but as three persons have been sentenced to death on the opinion of the third Judge, despite the opinion of one that the death sentence should not be imposed and of the other that the appellants are not guilty and so should be acquitted, we have deemed it advisable to examine the evidence. Two of the eye witnesses were considered unreliable by Reddy, J. in the High Court, so we will omit them from consideration and concentrate on the other two, Rasika Bai (P.W.1) and Subhana (P.W.7). Both give substantially the same version of what they saw of the assault. They heard Ramehander 's cries from the direction of the river bank and rushed there. They say they saw all five accused striking him, the three appellants Pandurang, Tukia and Bhilia with axes, the other two, who have not appealed, with sticks.

He was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis in January 1974 and appointed as a Head Clerk on April 1, 1975. The appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, asking that he should be absorbed in Government service as a clerk. The writ petition having been dismissed, the appellant has filed this appeal by special leave. The appellant was entitled to be absorbed in Government service as a clerk in any event. But, as a result of the deletion of section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973, the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat. The fact that the appellant was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis in January 1974, or the further fact that he was appointed as a Head Clerk on April 1, 1975, cannot improve his position for the simple reason that these appointments were made after June 13, 1973, being the date on which the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat. It is urged by Shri Jain who appears on behalf of the appellant that by reason of section 14(4) of the Amending Act, the appellant was entitled to continue in the service of the Panchayat on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti until he was absorbed in Government service. Since the appellant, according to the terms and conditions of his service with the Panchayat, was entitled to be considered for promotion, his appointment as a Head Clerk prior to his absorption in Government service had to be recognised and protected, despite the fact that such appointment was made after June 13, 1973 when the Amending Act came into force. There is no substance in this contention. Even assuming for the purposes of argument that the right to be considered for promotion is a term and condition of service, what is relevant for our purpose is not whether the appellant was entitled to be considered for promotion but, whether the Panchayat Samiti had the right to appoint him to the post of Head Clerk on the date on which it purported to do so. Clearly, it had fortified that right on June 13, 1973. It could not, therefore, have appointed the appellant as a Head Clerk, as it purported to do, in January"

The facts in all these appeals are identical and the only facts necessary for our purpose are these: Each of the appellants/petitioners is a registered dealer in the State of Haryana. He purchased certain raw materials in the State without paying tax thereon, in view of the provision contained in section 24 of the Act. He then manufactured certain goods in the State with the aid of said raw materials. He then sold the manufactured goods to dealers who, in turn, exported those goods out of India. On these facts, it is claimed, the assessee is not liable to pay the purchase tax on the raw materials imposed under section 9(1) of the Act. This claim has been rejected by the taxing authorities and the High Court and hence these appeals.

In their return of turnover for the period from April 1, 1954 to March 31, 1955, they claimed exemption from Sales Tax in respect of sales of cotton of the total value of Rs. 68,493 2 6 and sales of castor oil of the total value of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6 on the ground that these sales were oil FOB contracts, under which they continued to be the owners of the goods till the goods had crossed the customs barrier and thus entered the export stream, and so no tax was realisable on these sales in view of the provisions of article 286(1)(b). The Sales Tax Officer rejected this claim for exemption and assessed them to sales tax on a taxable turnover including these sales. He also assessed them to purchase tax under section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act on their purchase of castor oil which they later sold for the sum of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6 as mentioned above. The notice of demand for the total sales tax and the purchase tax assessed was served on the sellers on September 30, 1956. The sellers thereupon moved the Bombay High Court under article 226 of the Constitution for the issue of appropriate writs for quashing the order of assessment and the notice of demand and for prohibiting the Sales Tax Officer from taking any steps pursuant to the order or the notice.

In this view the learned Judge dismissed the application under article 226. Against this decision the sellers appealed.

The respondent, her former husband, contested the claim on the ground that she was a divorcee and therefore ineligible for maintenance. The magistrate held that the appellant was a subsisting wife and awarded monthly maintenance of Rs. 300/ for the son and Rs. 400/ for the mother. The respondent appealed to the sessions judge who dismissed the petition in allowance of the appeal. The High Court summarily dismissed a revision petition. The appellant has come up in appeal by special leave. The appellant contended that the Courts below had overlooked the plain provision in the Explanation (b) to section 125(1) of the Code, which reads: \"wife ' includes a woman who has been divorced by or has obtained a divorce from, her husband and has not remarried. On this foundation, he urged that accepting the contention of the respondent that the appellant was a divorcee, her client was still entitled to an allowance. The respondent contended that section 125(4) would apply in the absence of proof that the lady was not living separately by mutual consent. He also contended that there must be proof of neglect to maintain to attract s.125 and that there was a settlement by consent decree in 1962 whereby the mehar money had been paid and all claims adjusted, and so no claim for maintenance could survive. The third contention was that the payment of mehar money, as a customary discharge, was within the cognisance of section 127(3) (b) which reads: \"(b) the woman has been divorced by her husband and that she has received, whether before or after the date of the said order, the whole of the sum which, under any customary or personal law applicable to the parties, was payable on such divorce cancel such order, (i) in the case where such sum was paid before such order, from the date on which such order was made.

It belonged to several co owners. These co owners had leased out the properties under two lease deeds in favour of M/s. India Automobiles, which was then the sole proprietary concern of one of them, Ganshyamdas Girdhardas (G.G.), but was converted subsequently, in 1961, into a partnership concern of G.G. and his four sons. The firm and its partners are hereinafter referred to as 'the tenants '. The first lease (Ext. P 1) was dated 22.9. 1947 and related to Door No. 2 (Item No. 1 in Schedule A to the plaint). This was a property comprising of an area of 4 grounds and 151 square feet with certain buildings thereon. The rent for the premises was Rs. 150 per month. The second lease deed (Ext. P 2), dated 3.10. 1947 relating to Door No. 3 (Item 2 in Schedule A to the plaint) covered an area of 8700 sq. and some building thereon. The rent as per lease deed was Rs.200 per month. On 30.7.1953, all the co owners of the property (including G.G.) sold the property to the United India Life Assurance Company and the New Guardian of India Life Insurance Company Ltd. In 1956, the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) stepped into the shoes of these two insurance companies and became the owner of the property. On 20.7.65, the LIC moved two applications (being HRC Nos. 3310 and 3311 of 1965) in the court of the Rent Controller (Sri A.

The Import & Export Policy for the period April, 1978 to March, 1979, in para 174, made provision for grant of certain import facilities to Export Houses which were registered in accordance with the provisions of the said Policy. One of the said facilities was grant of an Additional licence in terms of para 176 of the said Policy for an amount to be calculated at one third the f.o.b. value of the exports of select products made by the Export House in the year 1977 78. The petitioners submitted application for registration as Export Houses and for grant of Export House Certificate which would have entitled them to the grant of such Additional licence.

This was on the basis of a complaint made by the appellant that the food served in the canteen was substandard. The prosecution case is that the appellant thereafter took food in the canteen for two days and being dissatisfied discontinued the practice before the notice was issued. The prosecution witnesses supported the case. PW 1 affirmed the fact that the appellant made the demand and had also received the amount on 22.10. The recovery of the currency notes from the appellant was not challenged. The plea of the appellant was that PW 1 had returned the amount due to him and there had been no demand for a bribe as there had been no occasion for doing so. The Trial Court accepted the prosecution evidence, rejected the plea of the appellant and recorded the conviction. Before the High Court, the contentions of the appellant were that there was no independent evidence regarding the demand, the messenger who had contacted PW 1 at the behest of the appellant had not been examined, the solitary evidence of PW 1 is insufficient, the explanation offered by the appellant was probable and there is no conclusive evidence to hold that the appellant was guilty.

The three appeals are directed against the judgment and order of the Andhra Pradesh High Court dated November 20, 1957, whereby three writ petitions, namely, No. 1 of 1956, No. 19 of 1957 and No. 470 of 1957, which had been filed by the appellant and were heard together, were dismissed with costs. The facts giving rise to these appeals may now be narrated.

It was further stipulated that if the leases were given continuously for five years, then the lessee would be entitled at the end of the fifth year to obtain a lease from the Rajah for a period of 20 years commencing from the termination of the fifth year. On the expiry of the fifth year, however, the Rajah granted another lease to the said Balumuri Nageswara Rao for a short period commencing from February 1, 1947, and ending on November 30, 1947.

On September 7, 1949 the Venkatagiri estate was notified under section 3 of the Madras Estate (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act 1948 (Madras Act XXVI of 1948), hereinafter referred to as the abolition Act. On the same date the appellant applied to the Collector for confirmation of the lease granted by the Rajah to him. Nothing appears to have happened until February 12, 1952, when a notice was issued from the office of the Board of Revenue (Andhra) calling upon the appellant to show cause within two months from the date of receipt"
