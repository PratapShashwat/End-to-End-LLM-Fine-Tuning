The Wealth Tax Officer, appealed to the Appellate Tribunal and con tended that the accrued interest was liable to be included in the Wealth Tax assessment of the assessee, relying on the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Vedrevu Venkappa Rao vs Commissioner of Wealth Tax A.P. The Appellate Tribunal dismissed the appeal, as it was bound by the decision of the Orissa High Court. The Commissioner of Wealth Tax applied under Section 27(1) of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957 for a reference to the Supreme Court in view of the conflict of opinions between the Orissa High Court and the Andhra Pradesh High Court and the question: \"Whether the Wealth Tax Officer was justified in including in the net wealth of the assessee, interest due on accrual basis (though not realised) on the outstandings 307 of the assessee 's money lending business, the accounts being maintained on cash,\" was referred to this Court. ^ HELD: 1. Even though the accounts of the assessee are maintained on cash basis interest due on accrual basis, though not realised, on the out standings of the money, lending business is liable to be included in the net wealth of the assessee.

[310F] 2.1. The system of accounting, mercantile or cash or hybrid, is of no relevance for the purpose of determining the assets of the assessee. That appears plainly from the definition of \"net wealth\" which speaks of \"the aggregate value. of all the assets\" belonging to the assessee on the valuation date. All the assets of the assessee, bar those expressly excepted by the statute, are to be taken into account, and it is immaterial whether the assessee employs one system of accounting or another.

Where the asset is an asset other than cash, its value is determined pursuant to sub section (I) of section 7 as the estimated price, which, in the opinion of the Wealth Tax Officer, the asset would fetch if sold in the open market on the valuation date. It would be the estimated open market value of the rights in the property which constitute the asset. [310E F] Vedrevu Venkappa Rao vs Commissioner of Wealth tax A.P. , Commissioner of Wealth, Tax.

The Union of India has preferred the Civil Appeal No. 1709 of 1988. Parma Nanda seeking a complete exoneration from the charge has preferred the SLP No. 6998 of 1988. The question which has to be decided, therefore, is whether the Tribunal has power to modify the penalty awarded by the Competent authority on the ground that it is excessive or disproportionate to the misconduct proved? The answer to the question cannot be determined without reference to the scope of judicial review in the pre Tribunal period. It is also necessary to remember the purpose for which the Tribunal came to be established. Before the Tribunal was constituted, the Courts were exercising judicial review of administrative decisions in public services. This judicial review was sought to be taken away by the Constitution (42nd Amendment Act, 1976). By this amendment, Articles 323A and 323B were introduced in the Constitution, thereby opening altogether a new chapter in our Administrative law. Article 323A(1) which is relevant for our purpose is confined to matters relating to the public services. It provides power to Parliament to enact law for establishment of Administrative Tribunals for adjudication of disputes with regard to service matters. The service matters are of persons appointed to the public service and posts. The public service and posts may be in connection with the affairs of the union or of any State. The law to be enacted by Parliament may also cover persons appointed in the local or other authority or of any corporation owned or controlled by the Government. There should be only one Tribunal for the Union of India and one for each State or for two or more States put together. The law cannot provide for hierarchy of Tribunals. In pursuance of Articles 323A(1) the Parliament enacted the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985 (\"The Act\"). We may briefly examine the statutory framework. Section 4 of the Act provides for establishment of Central Administrative Tribunal as well as State Administrative Tribunal. It also provides power to constitute Benches of the Central Administrative Tribunal. Sections 5 to 11 deal with the composition of Tribunals and Benches thereof and terms of office of the Chairman, Vice Chairman and other members thereof. Section 14 provides powers and authority to",

He, along with other two employees, was charg ed with the fraudulent act of withdrawal of Rs.238.90 by pr e paring a bogus pay bill and identity card in the name of a fictitious person. An enquiry was conducted against all t he three employees under the Punjab Government Servants Condu ct Rules, 1966 and the Inquiry Officer found all the thr ee guilty of the charge framed against each of them. The comp e tent authority accepted the findings of the Inquiry Offic er and after giving an opportunity of being heard imposed t he penalty of dismissal on the respondent. Minor penalty of with holding two or three future increments was imposed on each of the other two employees. The respondent challeng ed the finding of the Inquiry Officer as well as the order of dismissal by filing a writ petition in the High Court of Himachal Pradesh. Subsequently the writ stood transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal under the 20 provisions of the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985. T he Tribunal agreed with the findings recorded by the Inqui ry Officer to the effect that the respondent was guilty of t he charge but modified the punishment by reducing the punis h ment of dismissal imposed to that of stopping his fi ve increments on the ground that the respondent was measur ed with a different yardstick than the other two employee section Against the aforesaid order of the Tribunal appeals we re filed before this Court; (a) by the Union of India conten d ing that the tribunal has no powers to interfere with t he punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority on t he ground that it is disproportionate to the proved misdeme a nour, and (b) by the respondent seeking a complete exoner a tion from the charge. While allowing the appeal of the Union and dismissi ng the Special Leave Petition of the respondent the Court s et aside the order of the Tribunal, and, HELD: 1. Under the provisions of the Administrati ve Tribunal Act, 1985 the powers of the High Courts und er Article 226, in so far as they are exercisable in relati on to service matters stand conferred on the Tribunal esta b lished under the Act. The powers of other ordinary civ il Courts in relation to service matters to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognisan ce either expressly or impliedly barred also stand conferred on the Tribunal. The Act thus excludes the jurisdiction, pow er and authority of all Courts except the Supreme Court a nd confers the same on the Tribunal in relation to recruitme nt and service matters. The Tribunal is just a substitute to the civil Court and High Court. The Tribunal thus cou ld exercise only such powers which the civil Court or the Hi gh Court could have exercised by way of judicial review. It is neither less nor more. [27D E; 28B C1 S.P. Sampat Kumar vs Union of India & Ors., ; referred to; 2. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal to interfere wi th the disciplinary matters or punishment cannot be equat ed with an appellate jurisdiction. The Tribunal cannot inte r fere with the findings of the Inquiry Officer or compete nt authority where they are not arbitrary or utterly pervers e. The power to impose penalty on a delinquent officer is conferred on the competent authority either by an Act of legislature or rules made under the proviso to Article 3 09 of the Constitution. If there has been an enquiry consiste nt with the rules and in accordance with principles of natur al justice what punishment would meet the 21 ends of justice is a matter exclusively within the jurisdi c tion of the competent authority. If the penalty can lawful ly be imposed and is imposed on the proved misconduct, t he Tribunal has no power to substitute its own discretion f or that of the authority. The adequacy of penalty unless it is malafide is certainly not a matter for the Tribunal to concern with. The Tribunal also cannot interfere with t he penalty if the conclusion of the Inquiry Officer or t he competent authority is based on evidence even if some of it is found to be irrelevant or extraneous to the matte r.

            "reference": "The plaintiff, predecessor in interest of the appellants, flied a suit for a declaration and an injunction to restrain the defendant respondents from dispossessing him from a certain property comprising of a coconut grove. The trial court dismissed the suit holding that the, plaintiff was no more in possession of the suit property, and, therefore, a suit for a mere declaration simplicitor could not lie. Consequently, the plaintiff flied another suit for restoration of possession. His case was that he was a tenant of the suit property, whereof defendant No. 2 was the owners ' and 1016 that he was forcibly dispossessed by defendant No. 1, in collusion with defendant No. 2, without his tenancy having been lawfully terminated. It was alleged that the defendants were trespassers and liable to be evicted. The defendants, besides raising the pleas of res judicata and/or constructive res judicata purported to be based on Order 2 Rule 2(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, contended that defendant No. 1 was in lawful possession of the suit property as the same was let out to him by defendant No. 2 after the lease in favour of the plaintiff stood terminated by efflux of time, and the suit, as such, was not maintainable. The trial court decreed the suit holding that the suit property was demised to the plaintiff as he was the lawful tenant thereof, and defendant No. 1 in collusion with defendant No. 2 wrongfully dispossessed him. The appeal riled by the defendants was dismissed by the first appellate court. The second appeals filed by the defendants were allowed by the High Court holding that the suit was barred by res judicata as well as Order 2 Rule 2(3) C.P.C. The High Court also held that during the pendency of the suit as a result of the amendment of the Goa, Daman and Diu Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1964 by Act 17 of 1976, known as the Fifth Amendment, the definition of 'agriculture ' was changed and the suit property came to be covered within the expression 'agricultural land ' which rendered the civil court without jurisdiction and the decree passed by it unsustainable. Aggrieved, the heirs and legal representatives of the plaintiff, filed the appeal by special leave. Allowing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1.1 A subsequent suit would be barred by res judicata only when the subject matter of the suit was directly and substantially in issue in the previous suit. [p. 1022 C] 1.2. The first suit was dismissed on a technical ground that the suit for a mere declaration without seeking consequential relief of possession could not lie. In that suit the issue regarding the status of the plaintiff as a lessee was not settled once for all and hence that issue could not be stated to be barred by res judicata in the subsequent suit brought by the lessee for possession of the demised property. The High Court was not right in holding 1017 that the second suit was barred by res judicata. 1022 F H] 2.1. Order 2 Rule 2 CPC is based on,the salutory principle that a defendant or defendants should not be twice vexed for the same cause by splitting the claim and the reliefs. It does not preclude a second suit based. on a distinct cause of action. [p. 1023 C E] 2.2. The doctrine of res judicata differs from the rule embodied In Order 2 Rule 2, in that, the former places emphasis on the plaintiff 's duty to exhaust all available grounds in support of his claim while the latter requires the plaintiff to claim all reliefs emanating from the same cause of action. [p. 1023 E] 2.3. The cause of action for the former suit was based on an apprehension that the defendants were likely to forcibly dispossess the plaintiff. The suit was for an injunction and not for possession of the demised property. It was not on the premise that the plaintiff had in fact been illegally and forcibly dispossessed and needed the court 's assistance to be restored to possession. Therefore, the subsequent suit was based on a distinct cause of action not found in the former suit. The High Court was not right in concluding that the suit was barred by Order 2 Role 2(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, and that the difference in the reliefs claimed in the two suits was immaterial and irrelevant. In the previous suit, the relief for possession was not claimed whereas in the second suit the relief was for restoration of possession. That makes all the difference. [pp. 1023 F, 1024 B D] 3.1. The impact of the Fifth Amendment on pending litigation is that the question of tenancy in regard to agricultural land cannot be decided by the civil court under the Act and there being no express saying clause permitting the civil court to decide the same, any decision rendered by the civil court would be without jurisdiction. The change in law deprived the civil court of jurisdiction which it undoubtedly possessed on the date of the institution of the suit. Thus, the provisions of the Fifth Amendment would apply to pending suits also. [pp. 1027 D E; 1028 D E; 1029 C] Shah Bhojraj Kuverji Oil Mills and Ginning Factory vs Subhash Chandra Yograj Sinha; , , relied on. The Act does not preclude the institution of a suit by a tenant 1018 for restoration of possession from a trespasser. [p. 1029 C] 3.3. If a suit Is riled to recover possession of agricultural land from a trespasser and no dispute arises, the adjudication whereof is required to be done by the special machinery set up under the Act, the civil court will continue to have jurisdiction. [p. 1027 F G] 3A. If possession of agricultural land is sought on the plea that the defendant is a trespasser and the defendant contends that he is a tenant, the claim of tenancy by defendant cannot be gone into by the civil court in view of the clear language of S.7 read with section 58(2) of the Act In such a situation, it would not stand to reason to non suit the plaintiff who had flied the suit in a competent court having jurisdiction to try the same, merely because of the subsequent change in law. The proper course, therefore, would be that the issue whether the defendant was a tenant should be referred to the Mamlatdar for decision and, after his decision is received by the civil court, if the issue is held against the defendant, the civil court may consider passing of a. decree. for eviction but if, on the other hand, he is held to be a tenant, the civil court may be required to dismiss the suit [pp. 1029 F H; 1030 A B; 1031 D E] Bhimaji Shankar Kulkam vs Dundappa Vithappa Udapudi & Anr., ; =. ; and Dhondi Tukaram vs Hari Dadu, AIR 1954 Bom. 100 = ILR , relied on. The impact of Fifth Amendment may give rise to a situation where a deemed tenant under s.4 of the Act is evicted from the land on or after 1st July, 1962; his remedy under s.8(2) is to approach the authority under the Act for recovery of possession of the land of which he has been disposed, and jurisdiction of the civil court stands wholly barred by virtue of s.58(2) of the Act as it would not be competent to pass any order for restoration of possession to the deemed tenant. If such a situation arises in a pending suit which was instituted in a competent court having jurisdiction at the date of its institution, it would be unfair to non suit the plaintiff altogether for no fault of his own and the proper course would be to follow in spirit the procedure outlined in Order 7, Rules 10 and 10A, C.P.C. [pp. 1031 F H; 1032 A B] 4. The High Court lacked jurisdiction to decide the question regarding tenancy on merits. Its order is set aside and the matter is remitted to 1019 the trial court to determine the course of action to be adopted in accordance with the guideline indicated hereinabove. [p. 1032 D F]",

The principle of 'equal pay for equal work ' has no mechanical application in every case of similar work. No two jobs by the mere nomenclature or by the volume of work performed can be rated as equal. It is not just a comparison of physical activity. It requires the consideration of various dimensions of the job. The accuracy required by the job and the dexterity it entails may differ from job to job.

The appellant claimed that Lakshmamma was entitled to make a will in respect of her half share in the properties in suit and that the will was genuine and valid. Respondent I, the sole heir of Lakshmamma, resisted the appellant 's claim and alleged that Lakshmamma was not competent to make a will in respect of any of the properties in suit. She also alleged that the will was not genuine and valid and that it had been brought into existence through the machinations of the appellant. The learned trial judge held that the will was genuine and valid and that the rule of survivorship applied to the properties conveyed by the said will. He also held that the rule of survivorship did not apply to the properties purchased by Sadagopalachar, Lakshmamma 's husband, out of the joint income from the properties bequeathed to him and his wife by Annaji lyengar. The learned judge held that the properties purchased by Sadagopalachar were purchased out of the income of the properties of his father and of his mother.

The High Court referred to the fact that the appellants had not produced their account books to show that they had been purchased by persons other than those who ran cinemas or for any other use. Of course, it is very difficult to identify a taxable commodity merely by the use to which it may be put. Nevertheless, it appears that the entry under consideration links the taxable object with its general or ordinary use. The taxing authorities were, therefore, compelled to consider the use which is generally made of the arc carbons. They had concluded that the common or ordinary use of the arc carbons was that they exuded their power foul light cast, through the projectors, on cinema screens. It was pointed out that the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal, the final departmental authority under the Act, had allowed an application for adducing expert evidence to determine the question whether arc carbons manufactured by the appellant company could be covered by the entry under consideration. It, however, appears that, before further evidence could be taken, at the appellate stage, on the subject, a decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, in the State of Andhra Pradesh vs Srimathi Nidmarthi Saraswathi Devi(1), was brought to the notice of the Tribunal. There, the High Court had held that such arc carbons are covered by the 4th entry in the 1st Schedule of the Madras General Sales Tax Act. Hence, the Tribunal dismissed the appeal without taking further evidence. In the High Court, two decisions cited on behalf of the appellants were: Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Madhurai Division, Madhurai vs Ravi Auto Stores(2), and State of Madras vs Indian oxygen Ltd. (3). The High Court pointed out that in both these cases what was decided was whether \"welding electrodes\", considered by themselves, were \"electrical goods\" falling within entry 41 of Schedule 1 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act. It was held, in these cases, that they were only copper rods which were melted by electrical power in the process of welding. Neither the use of the term \"electrode\" to",

Entry 4 occurs in a Schedule of taxable goods. When it was intended to confine an entry to particular gadgets and 'parts thereof ' the entry said so. Entry 4, however, includes 'parts ' as well as 'accessories '. The term 'accessories ' is used to describe goods which may have been manufactured for use as an aid or addition to particular machines, though, they may serve as aids to other kinds of instruments also. But, this entry and other entries use the expression 'required for use therewith '. The description of the goods in these entries indicates that the expression has been employed for equipment or accessories connected with the main purpose. Therefore, it is its general of predominant use that determines the category in which an article will fall. [563D F, G; 564B C] In the present case, the main use of Arc Carbons was proved to be that of production of powerful light used in projectors in Cinemas. The fact that they can also be used for other purposes such as for search lights etc., will not detract from their classification under Entry 4.

In order to understand the case of the petitioners it is necessary to set out some other provisions of law governing the case. The Act was passed in the year 1957 by Parliament to provide for the regulation of mines and development of minerals under the control of the Union and it was made applicable to the whole of India. Under section 3A of the Act the word 'minerals ' is defined as including all minerals except mineral oils.

It is under this Notifica tion that the rate of royalty in respect of Black trap and Hard Murrum was increased from Rs.4 to Rs. 7 per metric tonne. The validity of Rule 21 as it stood prior to its amend ment by the aforesaid impugned notification was considered and upheld by this Court on March 6, 1986 in D.K. Trivedi & Sons & Ors. vs State of Gujarat & Ors. , ; The impugned notification was issued at a time when the Writ Petitions in the aforesaid case were pending in the High Court. The increase in the levy of royalty effected by the impugned notification is now questioned in these petitions. The Petitioners raised the following contentions viz; (1) That the royalty levied and covered under the Rules should be applied only for mineral development and since the royalty is being treated as part of the consolidated fund of the State and used for other purposes by the State, the levy was bad; and (2) That the impugned notification in question was in contravention of clause (c) of article 304 of the constitution. (3) That the impugned notification is discriminatory in character. 407 Dismissing the Writ Petitions, this Court, HELD: That Act is no doubt passed for development of minerals but while discharging its functions relating to development, if the State incidentally allows mining to be carried on in the public interest and levies in that connec tion a tax, it does not mean that the said tax should be used only for development of minerals and not for other purposes sanctioned by law.

The minerals belong to the Government and if anybody wants to have the right as a lessee to exploit the mines to the exclusion of others and to remove the minerals with a view to making profit, he has to pay a royalty imposed in accordance with law. [412E] In the instant case, the levy is made under a law made by the Central Government. It is not an imposition made by a law made by the State Legislature on which alone, the re striction contemplated under article 304(b) applies.

The appellant was elected as a trustee by the Sengunatha Mudaliars of Manjakollai village at a meeting held on June 27, 1957. According to the appellant the temple was rounded two hundred years ago by the members of his community and since then the management of the temple and its affairs was always vested in the community of the Sengunatha Mudaliars and no person other than the elected trustee had at any time the right of management and control of the temple. The respondents, however, took a different view and proceeded on the basis that trusteeship of the Kumaran Koil was not hereditary. The Subordinate Judge held that the appellant was a hereditary trustee and the suit was not barred by limitation. The respondents took the matter in appeal to the Madras High Court which by its judgment dated March 31, 1965 allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Subordinate Judge. Section 6, sub section (9) of Madras Act 1 of 1925 states: \"In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context (9) 'hereditary trustee ' means the trustee of a religious institution succession to whose office devolves by hereditary right or is regulated by usage or is specifically provided for by the founder, so long as such scheme of succession is in force;\" This Act has been substituted by Madras Act 22 of 1959 but the definition of the trustee is identical in both the Acts. The question to be considered in this appeal is whether the appellant is a hereditary trustee Within the meaning of the section.

The office of a hereditary trustee is in the nature of property. Succession in relation to property implies passing of an interest from one person to another.

In such a case, it is not possible to say there is a succession to the office, because: (a) on the efflux of the period for which one trustee is appointed, there is a vacancy and another is elected to that vacancy, and (b) since there is a possibility of the same trustee being reelected, an impossible legal position arises in which a person could be a successor of himself.

The learned Additional Sessions judge acquitted the appellant of all these offences. The State then preferred an appeal against his acquittal to the High Court of Allahabad but restricted the appeal to the acquittal of the appellant in respect of offences under section 52 of the Act. The High Court held that the appellant had secreted the five registered letters in question and on this finding set aside his acquittal and convicted him in each of the three appeals for offences under section 52 of the Act and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year in each case. The appellant has come up to this Court by special leave. Briefly stated the prosecution case is that when the house in which the appellant lives along with his father Diwan Singh, a retired Police Head Constable, was searched by the C.I.D. Inspector, S.N. Singh, along with Masood Murtaza, Sub Inspector of Police, Bulandshahr on May 12, 1956, in connection with a case against Messrs Greenwood Publicity, they accidentally discovered a large number of letters and postcards and also the five registered letters in question. At the time of the search the appellant who happens to be a trade union official, was not in Bulandshahr but was away on leave at Delhi in connection with a postal conference. These articles were found in an almirah, the key of which was produced by the appellant 's father. The articles were not listed at the spot but were taken to the Kotwali in a sealed packet and later on listed there. A number of other articles were also seized at that time but we are not concerned with them as they have no connection with the charges against the appellant. Briefly, the appellant 's defence in all these cases is that there are two factions in the Bulandshahr post office and that these articles were planted by the opposite party. According to him, the planting must have occurred in the Kotwali when the Sub Inspector purported to make a list of the articles seized from the house in which the appellant lives. Further, according to him, neither the house nor the almirah from which the articles are said to have been seized was in his",

Certain undelivered postal articles were re covered from an almirah in the house, the key of which was produced by the father. The appellant was tried and convicted of an offence under section 52 Post Offices Act for secreting postal articles. The appellant contended that since it had not been proved that he had been entrusted with these articles the offence under section 52 was not made out and that lie could not be held guilty of secreting as he was not in exclusive possession of these articles. Held, that entrustment was not an essential ingredient of the offence under section 52. Where the legislature intended to make entrustment an ingredient of the offence it had used appropriate words to make it clear. It had used no such words in section 52. To secrete means to hide. In a case like the present, the retention of an undelivered postal article in an almirah for an inordinately long period would be tantamount to hiding that article. Held, further, that the appellant was not in exclusive possession of the postal articles and no inference could be drawn 409 that he had secreted them. As the key was produced by the appellant 's father it could not be inferred that the appellant was in joint possession of the almirah much less that he was in exclusive possession of it. No inference could be drawn from the fact that the almirah contained certain other articles belonging to the appellant as it also contained a large number of articles belonging to the father.",

Sheo Sahai died of the injuries received. The appellant thereafter proceeded to the Canal Distributory at some distance from the village and had a bath there. Later on, he went to the Police Station, Ekdil, nine miles away and lodged a report. He delivered the sword which has been found by the Serologist to be stained with human blood. The appellant was taken in custody and as a result of the investigation was sent up for trial. The appellant denied the allegation that he had caused the death of Sheo Sahai and alleged that he was falsely accused of the offence. He also denied the other allegations for the prosecution. He alleged that one Paley Singh informed him about the murder of Sheo Sahai and asked him to go to the Police Station, Ekdil, and to inform the Station Officer orally about the murder. He did accordingly. He was detained at the Police Station till 11 a.m., the next day and was then put up in the lock up. The Sub Inspector took his thumb impression forcibly on three papers, but did not tell him the reason. The appellant adduced no evidence in support of his statement. The Courts below rightly did not accept his version. The evidence led by the prosecution consisted of the evidence relating to motive, to his extrajudicial confession to one Ujagar Singh when he was having a bath in the Canal, to his purchasing the sword and to his delivering it at the police Station after he had dictated the report. Both the Courts below rightly believed the evidence about the motive and the purchase of the sword by the appellant. The learned Sessions Judge believed Ujagar Singh and acted on the extra judicial confession made by the appellant to him. The High Court, however, did not rely on this extra judicial confession.

Evidence was also led of an extra judicial confession made by the appellant to one U but the High Court did not place reliance on it as it did not feel sure of it though it observed that a perusal of the statement of U showed that it was very likely that what he stated may have happened. ^ Held, that the statement of U regarding the extra judicial confession was erroneously rejected by the High Court. Extra judicial confessions were not usually considered with favour but such a confession coming from a person who had no reason to state falsely and to whom it was made in circumstances which tended to support his statement could be relied upon. The extra judicial confession in the present case was supported by the facts established, and these together fully established the guilt of the appellant.",

The High Court dismissed the petition holding that the petitioners were not entitled to any relief as they had approached the Court after undue delay. The question whether the petitioners were entitled to any relief is a question of law and we shall first examine whether the High Court was right in holding that the petitioners were not entitled to any relief on account of the inordinate delay involved in the presentation of the writ petition.

The respondent company and its directors were prosecuted for failure to file with the Registrar of Companies on or before 30th October 1967, the Balance sheet and profit and loss account of the company. By 30th September, 1967, admittedly, no general body meeting had been held. The High Court held that since no general body meeting was held, there could be no question of laying the balance sheet before the general body meeting and complying with the requirements of the section; and that, though the willful omission to call a general body meeting and of laying the balance sheet and profit and loss account before it may expose the persons responsible to punishment under other provisions of the Act, it would not make them liable either under section 134(4) of the 1913 Act or section 220 of the 1956 Act. Dismissing the appeal to this Court, HELD : On principle and authority it should be held that no offence was committed under section 220 of the . [417B] (a) The principle accepted by this Court in State of Bombay vs Bandhan Ram Bhandani [1961] 1 S.C.R_ 801, that a company or its directors in a prosecution under sections 32 and 133 of the 1913 Act, could not, in defence to such prosecution, rely upon their own failure to call the general body meeting would not apply to a prosecution under section 134 of the 1913 Act or section 220 of the 1956 Act. Unlike sections 32 and 133, the responsibility of I sending to the Registrar the copies of the balance sheet and profit and loss account arises only after they have been laid before the company at the general meeting, the obligation to do so being completely dependent on its being laid before a general meeting. [414H 415E] (b) Where the words in the section are clear it is unnecessary to consider whether it embodies any principle and whether that principle is consistent with the principle as embodied in other sections which are differently worded. In interpreting a penal provision it is not permissible to give an extended meaning to the plain words of the section on the ground of a principle recognised in certain other provisions. [415F G] (c) This is not a case where an accused person relies on his default and pleads his innocence. In the , various stages have to be gone through before we reach the stage of a copy of the balance sheet and the profit and loss account being filed with the Registrar. The failure to reach any one of the stages within the time prescribed is made penal by the Act. The respondents may be guilty of any of those offences but not of the offence with which they were charged. [416E G] (d) Further a daily penalty is provided after the thirtieth day mentioned in section 220 (1) of the 1956 Act. When no general body meeting was held it is not possible to calculate the period of 30 days and there would be diffi culty in working Cut he daily penalty.

            "reference": "The West Bengal Special Courts Act (X of 1950) was entitled \"An Act to provide for the speedier trial of cer tain offences,\" and the object of the Act. as declared in the preamble, was \"to provide for the speedier trial of certain offences\". Section 3 of the Act empowered the State Government by notification in the official gazette to con stitute Special Courts, and sec. 5 provided that \"A Special Court shall try such offences or classes of offences or cases or classes of cases, as the State Government may by general or special order in writing, direct. \" The Act laid down a procedure for trial before Special Courts which was different in several respects from that laid down by the Criminal Procedure Code for trial of offences generally. The respondent, who was convicted by a Special Court which tried his case under a notification issued by the Government under sec. 5, contended that the said section was unconsti tutional and void inasmuch as it contravened article 14 of the Constitution, which provides that \"the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protec tion of the laws within the territory of India\". 285 Held, per FAZL ALl, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA, CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR and BOsE JJ. (PATANJALI SASTRI C.J., dissenting) Section 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950, contravenes article 14 of the Constitution and is void inasmuch as (per FAZL ALl, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA, and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ.) the procedure laid down by the Act for the trial by the Special Courts varied substantially from that laid down for the trial of offences generally by the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Act did not classify, or lay down any basis for classification, of the cases which may be directed to be tried by the Special Court, but left it to the uncontrolled discretion of the State Government to direct any case which it liked to be tried by the Special Court. DAs J. Section 5 Il) of the Act, in so far as it empowered the State Government to direct \"offences\" or \"classes of offences\" or \"classes of cases\" to be tried by a Special Court, does not confer an uncontrolled and unguided power on the State Government but by necessary implication contemplates a proper classification and is not void. That part of the section which empowered the Government to direct \"cases\" as distinct from \"classes of cases\" to be tried by a Special Court is void. PATANJALI SASTRI C.J. Section 5 (1) of the Act is not void or unconstitutional wholly or even in part. Per FAZL ALl, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ. A rule of procedure laid down by law comes as much within the purview of article 14 of the Constitution as any rule of substantive law and it is necessary that all litigants, who are similarly situated, are able to avail themselves of the same procedural rights for rebel and for defence with like protection and without discrimination. (ii) If it is established that the person complaining has been discriminated against as a result of legislation and denied equal privileges with others occupying the same position, it is not incumbent upon him before he can claim relief on the basis of fundamental rights to assert and prove that, in making the law, the legislature was actuated by a hostile or inimical intention against a particular person or class ; nor would the operation of article 14 be excluded merely because it is proved that the legislature had no intention to discriminate, though discrimination was the necessary consequence of the Act. The question of intention may arise in ascertaining whether an officer acted mala fide or not; but it cannot arise when discrimination follows or arises on the express terms of the law itself. (iii) The language of sec. 5 (1) clearly and unambigu ously vests the State Government with unrestricted discre tion to direct any cases or class of cases to be tried by the Special Court, not a discretion to refer cases only when it is of opinion that a speedier trial is necessary 286 (iv) Assuming that the preamble throws any light on the section, the necessity of speedier trial is too vague, uncertain and elusive a criterion to form a rational basis for discrimination. (v) It cannot be said that an Act does not contravene the equality rule laid down by article 14 simply because it confers unregulated discretion on officers or administrative bodies. The true position is that if the statute itself is not discriminatory the charge of Violation of the article may be only against the official who administers it, but if the statute itself makes a discrimination without any proper or reasonable basis, it would be void for being in conflict with article 14. (vi) The notification issued under the Act in the present case would also come within the definition of law and could be impeached apart from the Act if it violates article 14. DAS J. (1) Article 14 does not insist that every piece of legislation must have universal application and it does not take away from the State the power to classify persons for the purposes of legislation, but the classification must be rational, and in order to satisfy this test (i) the classification must be founded on an intelligible differen tia which distinguished those that are grouped together from others, and (ii) that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act. The differentia which is the basis of the classification and the object of the Act are distinct things and what is necessary is that there must be a nexus between them. But the mere fact that the inequality has not been made with the special intention of prejudicing a particular person or persons but in the general interest of administration will not validate a law if in fact it results in inequality of treatment. Nor can the constitutionality of a statute depend on the degree of the inequality brought about by the law. (2) Although the preamble to an Act cannot override the plain meaning of its operative parts, it may nevertheless assist in ascertaining what the true meaning or implication of a particular section is; and the part of sec. 5 ( 1 ) of the Act which relates to \"offences ' ', \"Classes of offences\" and \"classes of cases\", construed in the light of the pream ble, does not confer an uncontrolled and unguided power on the State Government, but by necessary implication and intendment empowers the State to classify the offences or classes of offences or classes of cases, that is to say, to make a proper classification having a relation to the object of the Act as recited in the preamble; and this part of sec. 5 (1) foes not therefore contravene article 14. (3) That part of sec. 5(1) which empowers the State Government to direct \"cases\" as distinct from \"classes of cases\" to be cried by the Special Court lies beyond the ambit of the object aid down by the preamble and contem plates and involves a purely arbitrary selection based on nothing more substantial 287 than the whim and pleasure of the State Government without any appreciable relation to the necessity for a speedier trial and therefore offends against the provisions of article 14 and is void. Bose J. The test under article 14 is neither classifica tion nor whether there is absolute equality in any academi cal sense of the term but whether the collective conscience of a sovereign democratic republic as reflected in the views of fair minded, reasonable, unbiassed men, who are not swayed by emotion or prejudice, can consider the impugned laws as reasonable, just and fair and regard them as that equal treatment and protection in the defence of liberties which is expected of a sovereign democratic republic in the conditions which obtain in India to day. PATANJALI SASTRI C.J. (dissenting). Section 5 (1) of the impugned Act is not void or unconstitutional wholly or even in part because: (1)The words in the enacting part of a statute must be confined to that which is the plain object and general intention of the legislature in passing the Act and the preamble affords a good clue to discover what that object was. The title and the preamble of the Act in the present case show unmistakably that the whole object and purpose of the Act was to devise machinery for the speedier trial of certain offences. The discretion intended to be exercised by the State Government must be exercised bona fide on a consideration of the special features or circum stances which call for comparatively prompt disposal of a case or cases proposed to be referred and sec. 5 (11 must be read as empowering the Government to direct the Special Court to try such offences or classes of offences or cases or classes of cases as in its judgment, require speedier trial. (2) Article 14 of the Constitution does not mean that all laws must be general in character and universal in application. The State must possess the power of distin guishing and classifying persons or things to be subjected to particular laws and in making a classification the legis lature must be allowed a wide latitude of discretion and judgment. The classification is justified if it is not palpably arbitrary but is founded on a reasonable basis having regard to the object to be attained. The powers of the legislature must include the power of entrusting an administrative body With a plenary but not arbitrary discre tion to be exercised so as to carry out the purpose of the Act and the mere fact that the discretion might be exercised arbitrarily by the administrative body cannot make the law itself unconstitutional. (4)The impugned Act does not in terms or by implication discriminate between persons or classes of persons nor does it purport to deny to any one equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws. (5) Even from the point of view of reasonable classification the expediency of speedier trial is not too vague or indefi nite to be the basis of classification. (6) The notifica tion of the Government in the present case referring the case to the Special Court did not contravene article 14 and is not void inasmuch as there is nothing 288 to show that the Government was influenced by any discrimi natory motive or design or acted arbitrarily, but on the other hand there are obviously special features which mark off the group of cases referred as requiring speedier dis posal.

            "reference": "In pursuance of r. 7A(1)(b) of the Central Health Service Rules, 1963 as amended by the Central Health Service (Amendment) Rules. 1966 and all other powers enabling in that behalf, the President of India issued a notification dated. June 8,1967 making the substantive appointment of the appellant Dr. Asim Kumar Bose as Radiologist, Irwin Hospital, New Delhi. By virtue of his post as Radiologist cum Associate Professor of Radiology, the appellant was teaching the under graduate and post graduate students as an Associate Professor of Radiology of the Maulana Azad Medical College for the M.D., M.S., D.M.R.T. And M B.B.S. courses of studies of the Delhi University. In 1973 the Central Government promoted Dr. K.P. Mittal, Lecturer in Radiology in the Maulana Azad Medical College as Associate Professor of Radiotherapy ignoring the claim of the appellant who thereupon made a representation. The Government of India, Ministry of Health & family Planning Department of Health by its letter dated February 23, 1974 rejected the representation holding that the appellant could not be considered for appointment to the post of Associate Professor of Radiotherapy in the Maulana Azad Medical College inasmuch as he did not possess at least five years ' teaching experience as Reader/Assistant Professor in the concerned speciality as required under r. 8(2A) and paragraph 3 of Annexure I to the Second Schedule of the 1966 Rules. The appellant filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court challenging the impugned order, but the High Court rejected the writ petition holding that the requirement rules required that the requisite teaching experience must be the experience gained while working in a medical college or in a teaching institution i.e. as a Teacher in a teaching department. Allowing the appeal. ^ HELD: (1) There was a failure on the part of the Government of India in the Ministry of Health to draw a distinction between teaching and non 17 teaching hospitals under the Central Health Service. The Irwin Hospital and the G.B. Pant Hospital are the two associate hospitals of the Maulana Azad Medical College and the teaching in the medical college is undertaken by Professors and Associate Professors as well as by the Specialists attached to the two hospitals affiliated to the College. Thus the teaching experience gained by the appellant while holding the post of Radiologist cum Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) had to be taken into consideration to determine his eligibility for appointment as Professor or Associate Professor of the concerned speciality. [35 G H, 36 A C, 43 F G] (2) On a construction of r. 8(2) and paragraph 2(b) of Annexure 1 to the Second Schedule of the 1966 Rules, it was held that the appellant possessed the qualifications and experience requisite for appointment to the post of Professor of Radiotherapy in the Maulana Azad Medical College which is a post belonging to Specialist Grade I equivalent to Supertime Grade II carrying a pay scale of Rs. 1800 2250, which had fallen vacant during the pendency of the appeal. The Union Public Service Commission must therefore re advertise the post of Professor and call the appellant for an interview for being considered for appointment to the post. [38 C D, F H] (3) The action of the Central Government in the Ministry of Health ignoring the claim of the appellant for appointment to the post of Associate Professor of Radiotherapy in the Maulana Azad Medical College in 1973 was based on a misconstruction of r. B(2A) and paragraph 3 of Annexure I to the Second Schedule. The word \"as\" in these provisions must, in the context in which it appears, be interpreted to mean \"in the capacity of\". These provisions must be interpreted in a broad and liberal sense as it would otherwise work great injustice of persons in Specialists Grade II like the appellant who, while holding a non clinical post in a teaching hospital like the Irwin Hospital, has actually been teaching the students of the Maulana Azad Medical College to which it is affiliated. The Ministry of Health cannot be heard to say that the appellant had not acquired the status of an Associate Professor of Radiology with effect from October 9, 1964, particularly when the Central Government have been utilizing his services as such for teaching the post graduate and under graduate students of the Maulana Azad Medical College for the M.D., M.S., D.M.R.T. and M.B.B.S. courses of studies for the last 17 years. The arrangement has continued for all these years with the approval of the Delhi University which has conferred the designation of Associate Professor of Radiology on the appellant presumably with the tacit sanction of the Medical Council of India. [37 F G, 38 A B, 42 D F] (4) The recruitment rules nowhere provide that the teaching experience gained by a Specialist in a teaching hospital in the capacity of an Associate Professor (ex officio) shall not count towards the requisite teaching experience for purposes of sub rs. (2) and (2A) of r. 8 and paragraph 2 (b) and 3 of Annexure I to the Second Schedule of the 1966 Rules. There is no provision made in the Rules that the teaching experience must be gained on a regular appointment. There is hardly any difference so far as teaching experience is concerned whether it is acquired on regular appointment or as a Specialist in a teaching hospital with the ex officio designation. As the statutory rules do not 18 provide that the teaching experience gained in an ex officio capacity shall not count towards the requisite teaching experience, the teaching experience gained by the appellant while holding the post of Radiologist cum Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) in the Irwin Hospital can not be ignored in determining his eligibility for appointment as Professor or Associate Professor of the concerned speciality.

An industrial dispute between these workmen and the management of Orient Paper Mills Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"the Company\") was referred by the State Government under section 10(1) (d) of the Industrial Disputes Act (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\") for adjudication by the Tribunal enumerating 30 different items of dispute. The Tribunal gave its award on all the thirty items. The special leave in this Court was sought and granted in respect of two matters covering some of these items. The first matter related to fixation of wages, including minimum wages, and this was covered by items Nos. 1, 3, 4, 22 and 26 in the Schedule attached to the Order of Reference. The second matter in the appeal related to bonus covered by item No. 2 of that Schedule. In the course of the hearing of the appeal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the workmen further gave up some of the points which were the subject matter of the items mentioned above, so that in this judgment we need deal with only those points which were argued by him in support of the appeal. The first and the main point argued with regard to wages was that the Tribunal, after holding that there was no identical industry in this region comparable with the Company, came to the view that there were other industries in the region in which minimum wages were higher than the minimum wages paid by the Company, but failed to fix the minimum wages in the award in accordance with the minimum wages being paid in those industries. Instead, what the Tribunal did was to work out the minimum wages, which should be paid, on an entirely different basis. It was also urged in the alternative that, even in adopting the latter course, the Tribunal committed an error inasmuch as, in making the calculation, the Tribunal only tried to neutralise about 36 per cent of the cost of living on the basis of the rise in Price Index instead of permitting neutralisation to the extent of at least 90%, which could have been done when fixing the minimum wages for the lowest class of workmen. The principle for fixation of minimum wages that should ordinarily be adopted was laid down by this Court in the case of French Motor Car Co. Limited vs Workmen(1) where it was held: \"It is now well settled that the principle of industry cum region has to be applied by an Industrial",
            "reference": "An industrial dispute regarding fixation of wages and bonus, between the respondent paper mills and its workmen, the appellants, was referred to the Industrial Tribunal in October, 1962, and the reference included a dispute about bonus payable for the years 1962 63 and 1963 64. The Tribunal held: (1 ) that there were in the region no ' other concerns in the same line of business which could be compared with the respondent but that there were three collieries, a steel plant, a cement factory and an aluminum company in the region which were comparable with the resportdent, that as the minimum wage in those industries which was about Rs. 95 was above that of the respondent, a revision of the minimum wage in the respondent mills was justified. that such minimum wage should be fixed for the price index prevailing at the time of the award taking 100 as the basic index for the year 1939, and that on that basis, the basic wage and dearness allowance should be Pa. 73, and that Pa. 11 was payable as production bonus; (2) that the dearness allowance element need not be linked to the price index, but that wage should be fixed at the prevailing price index leaving it to the workmen to ask for increase in minimum wage on any further rise in price index; (3 ) that the revised wages were payable with effect from 13th December, 1962; (4) that the three elements of basic wage, dearness allowance, and production bonus which make up the total minimum wage packet of Rs. 84 (Rs. 73 + Pa. 11) should be in the proportion of 3: 3: 1, and that profit bonus was payable at three months ' basic wage. The proportion of 3:3: 1 was fixed by the Tribunal, because, under an agreement of 1959 the management and workmen accepted that proportion by mutual consent. On the basis of that agreement, the Tribunal also held that; (5) casual workers should not be equated to permanent workers for purpose of minimum wages, and that casual and radii workers should not be allowed bonus on the same basis as the permanent workers; (6) The appellants also claimed before the Tribunal 6 months ' basic wage instead of 3 months ' basic wage, which was being paid by the respondent, on the assumption that certain before staff were being paid as bonus 3 months ' consolidated wage consisting of basic wage and dearness allowance; but the Tribunal rejected the claim. In appeal to this Court. HELD: (1) This Court laid down in French Motor Car Co. Ltd. vs Its Workmen, [1963] Supp. that where there is no concern in the same industry in the region comparable with the concern in which wages have to be fixed, greater emphasis should be laid on the region part of the industry cum region principle. To give full effect to this rule the Tribunal should have proceeded to fix the minimum wage in the respondent mills on the basis of the average minimum wage prevailing 667 in the other industries in that region. The respondent was not providing any amenities which should be taken into account in fixing the minimum wage, different from the amenities provided by those concerns in the region which were being compared. Therefore, the Tribunal should have fixed the minimum wage packet at Rs. 95 per mensem which was the average wage prevailing in all those concerns and should not have fixed the wages on an entirely different basis. [671 F H; 672 G H] (2) The Industrial, Tribunal has the discretion, in appropriate cases, of making a direction linking the dearness allowance element of a wage to the price index, or to fix the wage at the prevailing price index leaving the labour to raise a fresh demand and, if necessary, a fresh industrial dispute for further rise in wages, in case there is marked variation in price index and the wage fixed becomes outdated; and therefore. the Tribunal was not wrong in choosing the latter alternative. [674 F G; 675 B] Hydra (Engineers), vs The Workmen, ; , referred (3) This direction ' was objected to by respondents, on the ground that the respondent may have to pay arrears for 5 or 6 years which would be a heavy burden. But the previous agreement of 1959 was binding only upto 12th December, 1962. So, the Tribunal was right in directing that the revised wages should take effect from 13th December, 1962, in view of the considerable rise in the price index and the fact that the labour had not raised a fresh dispute for a further revision of wages since the date of the award. [675 G H] (4) No error was committed by the Tribunal in the break up of the wages into the 3 elements of basic wage, dearness allowance and production bonus in the proportion of 3: 3: 1. The contention of the workmen that the proportion should be 3:1: 1: so as to increase the basic wage element and consequently the profit bonus. was rightly rejected by the Tribunal, because. the proportion of 3:3:1 was accepted by mutual consent. [674 B C] (5) The distinction between casual workers and permanent workers for purpose of minimum wage, and casual and badli workers on the hand and permanent workers on the other for purpose of bonus, was recognised by the parties themselves in the agreement of 1959, and therefore, the Tribunal was right in keeping up the distinction in its award. [675 D E; 678 B C] (6) The allegation that some clerical staff was receiving what amounted to 6 months ' basic wage as bonus was incorrect. There was some clerical staff which did not get any dearness allowance and the bonus in their case was worked out on the basis of their wages which was only the basic wage. The appellants were wrong in assuming that the wage of such clerical staff was a consolidated wage consisting of the 2 elements of basic wage and dearness allowance. Therefore, the appellants could not claim 3 months ' consolidated wages as bonus which would amount to 6 months ' basic wage. [677 G H; 678 A B] It could not be urged by the appellants that calculation of available. surplus for purposes of bonus should have been on the basis of the Full Bench formula approved by this Court in Associated Cement Companies Ltd. vs Its Workmen, , for justifying 6 months ' basic wages as bonus, because, that was not the basis of the claim before the Tribunal. Further, the Tribunal was expected to decide the dispute only as referred to it, and at the time of the reference the accounts for the years 1962 63 and 1963 64 could not have been available, and therefore, 668 there could not possibly be a claim for higher bonus on the basis of the application of the Full Bench Formula.
