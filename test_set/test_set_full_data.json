        "reference": "The respondent assessee was assessed to wealth tax for the assessment years 1965 66, 1966 67 and 1967 68, in the status of a Hindu Undivided Family '. In each of the assessment years, the Wealth Tax Officer included a sum of Rs. 1.5 lakhs estimated as the accrued interest on the assessee 's money lending investments. The assessee appealed to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, con tending that as the books of account were maintained in accordance with the cash system of accounting, the accrued interest on the money lending investment could not be included in the Wealth Tax assessments, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner following the decision of the Orissa High Court in Commissioner of Wealth tax Bihar and Orissa vs Vysyaraju Badreenarayana Moorthy Raju (Orissa) (1971)79 ITR 330 deleted the additions representing accrued interest. The Wealth Tax Officer, appealed to the Appellate Tribunal and con tended that the accrued interest was liable to be included in the Wealth Tax assessment of the assessee, relying on the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Vedrevu Venkappa Rao vs Commissioner of Wealth Tax A.P. The Appellate Tribunal dismissed the appeal, as it was bound by the decision of the Orissa High Court. The Commissioner of Wealth Tax applied under Section 27(1) of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957 for a reference to the Supreme Court in view of the conflict of opinions between the Orissa High Court and the Andhra Pradesh High Court and the question: \"Whether the Wealth Tax Officer was justified in including in the net wealth of the assessee, interest due on accrual basis (though not realised) on the outstandings 307 of the assessee 's money lending business, the accounts being maintained on cash,\" was referred to this Court. ^ HELD: 1. Even though the accounts of the assessee are maintained on cash basis interest due on accrual basis, though not realised, on the out standings of the money, lending business is liable to be included in the net wealth of the assessee. [310G] 2. The value of a property refers to the value of the rights in that property. What accrues as a right also falls to be included within the assets of an assessee under the Wealth Tax Act 1957. [310F] 2.1. The system of accounting, mercantile or cash or hybrid, is of no relevance for the purpose of determining the assets of the assessee. That appears plainly from the definition of \"net wealth\" which speaks of \"the aggregate value. of all the assets\" belonging to the assessee on the valuation date. All the assets of the assessee, bar those expressly excepted by the statute, are to be taken into account, and it is immaterial whether the assessee employs one system of accounting or another.

Where the asset is an asset other than cash, its value is determined pursuant to sub section (I) of section 7 as the estimated price, which, in the opinion of the Wealth Tax Officer, the asset would fetch if sold in the open market on the valuation date. It would be the estimated open market value of the rights in the property which constitute the asset. [310E F] Vedrevu Venkappa Rao vs Commissioner of Wealth tax A.P. , Commissioner of Wealth, Tax.

Subsequently the writ stood transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal under the 20 provisions of the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985. T he Tribunal agreed with the findings recorded by the Inqui ry Officer to the effect that the respondent was guilty of t he charge but modified the punishment by reducing the punis h ment of dismissal imposed to that of stopping his fi ve increments on the ground that the respondent was measur ed with a different yardstick than the other two employee section Against the aforesaid order of the Tribunal appeals we re filed before this Court; (a) by the Union of India conten d ing that the tribunal has no powers to interfere with t he punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority on t he ground that it is disproportionate to the proved misdeme a nour, and (b) by the respondent seeking a complete exoner a tion from the charge.

The powers of other ordinary civ il Courts in relation to service matters to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognisan ce either expressly or impliedly barred also stand conferred on the Tribunal. The Act thus excludes the jurisdiction, pow er and authority of all Courts except the Supreme Court a nd confers the same on the Tribunal in relation to recruitme nt and service matters.

The Tribunal cannot inte r fere with the findings of the Inquiry Officer or compete nt authority where they are not arbitrary or utterly pervers e. The power to impose penalty on a delinquent officer is conferred on the competent authority either by an Act of legislature or rules made under the proviso to Article 3 09 of the Constitution.

The appeal challenges the decision of the High Court, which dismissed the plaintiff's suit for possession of the property. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**The Case:**\n\n* **Plaintiff:** Inacio Martins, deceased, represented by his legal representatives.\n* **Defendants:** Two individuals, defendants 1 and 2.\n* **Property:** Seven lots of coconut grove in Caranzalem, Goa.\n* **Plaintiff's Claim:** The plaintiff claimed to be a lessee of the property and sought possession of the land. He alleged he was forcibly dispossessed in June 1968.\n* **Defendants' Claim:** The defendants claimed they were rightful owners of the property and had leased it to defendant 1.\n\n**The Legal Issues:**\n\n1. **Res Judicata:** The High Court held that the plaintiff's previous suit for an injunction was barred by res judicata because the plaintiff had not been in possession of the property when the first suit was filed. The appeal argues that the High Court erred in applying res judicata to the plaintiff's claim.\n2. **Order 2 Rule 2(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure:** The High Court held that the plaintiff's claim was barred because he did not seek all reliefs in the first suit, including possession. The appeal argues that the High Court misconstrued the rule and that the plaintiff's claim was distinct from the previous suit.\n3. **Goa, Daman & Diu Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1964 (amended):** The Act was amended in 1976, and the High Court held that the Civil Court lost jurisdiction to decide the case after the amendment. The appeal argues that the amendment did not affect the Civil Court's jurisdiction to decide the case.\n\n**The Appeal's Arguments:**\n\n* The appeal argues that the High Court erred in applying res judicata to the plaintiff's claim.\n* The appeal argues that the High Court misconstrued Order 2 Rule 2(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n* The appeal argues that the High Court erred in concluding that the Civil Court lost jurisdiction to decide the case after the amendment.\n\n**The Appeal's Conclusion:**\n\nThe appeal seeks to overturn the High Court's decision and reinstate the plaintiff's claim for possession of the property. The appeal argues that the High Court's decision was based on a misinterpretation of the law and that the Civil Court should have retained jurisdiction to decide the case.\n\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The case highlights the complexities of property disputes in a jurisdiction with a specific agricultural tenancy law.\n* The case also raises questions about the application of res judicata and the interpretation of procedural rules in the context of legal amendments.\n* The case emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific legal framework governing property rights and tenancy in a particular jurisdiction.",
        "reference": "The plaintiff, predecessor in interest of the appellants, flied a suit for a declaration and an injunction to restrain the defendant respondents from dispossessing him from a certain property comprising of a coconut grove. The trial court dismissed the suit holding that the, plaintiff was no more in possession of the suit property, and, therefore, a suit for a mere declaration simplicitor could not lie. Consequently, the plaintiff flied another suit for restoration of possession. His case was that he was a tenant of the suit property, whereof defendant No. 2 was the owners ' and 1016 that he was forcibly dispossessed by defendant No. 1, in collusion with defendant No. 2, without his tenancy having been lawfully terminated. It was alleged that the defendants were trespassers and liable to be evicted. The defendants, besides raising the pleas of res judicata and/or constructive res judicata purported to be based on Order 2 Rule 2(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, contended that defendant No. 1 was in lawful possession of the suit property as the same was let out to him by defendant No. 2 after the lease in favour of the plaintiff stood terminated by efflux of time, and the suit, as such, was not maintainable. The trial court decreed the suit holding that the suit property was demised to the plaintiff as he was the lawful tenant thereof, and defendant No. 1 in collusion with defendant No. 2 wrongfully dispossessed him. The appeal riled by the defendants was dismissed by the first appellate court. The second appeals filed by the defendants were allowed by the High Court holding that the suit was barred by res judicata as well as Order 2 Rule 2(3) C.P.C. The High Court also held that during the pendency of the suit as a result of the amendment of the Goa, Daman and Diu Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1964 by Act 17 of 1976, known as the Fifth Amendment, the definition of 'agriculture ' was changed and the suit property came to be covered within the expression 'agricultural land ' which rendered the civil court without jurisdiction and the decree passed by it unsustainable. Aggrieved, the heirs and legal representatives of the plaintiff, filed the appeal by special leave. Allowing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1.1 A subsequent suit would be barred by res judicata only when the subject matter of the suit was directly and substantially in issue in the previous suit. [p. 1022 C] 1.2. The first suit was dismissed on a technical ground that the suit for a mere declaration without seeking consequential relief of possession could not lie. In that suit the issue regarding the status of the plaintiff as a lessee was not settled once for all and hence that issue could not be stated to be barred by res judicata in the subsequent suit brought by the lessee for possession of the demised property. The High Court was not right in holding 1017 that the second suit was barred by res judicata. 1022 F H] 2.1. Order 2 Rule 2 CPC is based on,the salutory principle that a defendant or defendants should not be twice vexed for the same cause by splitting the claim and the reliefs. It does not preclude a second suit based. on a distinct cause of action. [p. 1023 C E] 2.2. The doctrine of res judicata differs from the rule embodied In Order 2 Rule 2, in that, the former places emphasis on the plaintiff 's duty to exhaust all available grounds in support of his claim while the latter requires the plaintiff to claim all reliefs emanating from the same cause of action. [p. 1023 E] 2.3. The cause of action for the former suit was based on an apprehension that the defendants were likely to forcibly dispossess the plaintiff. The suit was for an injunction and not for possession of the demised property. It was not on the premise that the plaintiff had in fact been illegally and forcibly dispossessed and needed the court 's assistance to be restored to possession. Therefore, the subsequent suit was based on a distinct cause of action not found in the former suit. The High Court was not right in concluding that the suit was barred by Order 2 Role 2(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, and that the difference in the reliefs claimed in the two suits was immaterial and irrelevant. In the previous suit, the relief for possession was not claimed whereas in the second suit the relief was for restoration of possession. That makes all the difference. [pp. 1023 F, 1024 B D] 3.1. The impact of the Fifth Amendment on pending litigation is that the question of tenancy in regard to agricultural land cannot be decided by the civil court under the Act and there being no express saying clause permitting the civil court to decide the same, any decision rendered by the civil court would be without jurisdiction. The change in law deprived the civil court of jurisdiction which it undoubtedly possessed on the date of the institution of the suit. Thus, the provisions of the Fifth Amendment would apply to pending suits also. [pp. 1027 D E; 1028 D E; 1029 C] Shah Bhojraj Kuverji Oil Mills and Ginning Factory vs Subhash Chandra Yograj Sinha; , , relied on. The Act does not preclude the institution of a suit by a tenant 1018 for restoration of possession from a trespasser. [p. 1029 C] 3.3. If a suit Is riled to recover possession of agricultural land from a trespasser and no dispute arises, the adjudication whereof is required to be done by the special machinery set up under the Act, the civil court will continue to have jurisdiction. [p. 1027 F G] 3A. If possession of agricultural land is sought on the plea that the defendant is a trespasser and the defendant contends that he is a tenant, the claim of tenancy by defendant cannot be gone into by the civil court in view of the clear language of S.7 read with section 58(2) of the Act In such a situation, it would not stand to reason to non suit the plaintiff who had flied the suit in a competent court having jurisdiction to try the same, merely because of the subsequent change in law. The proper course, therefore, would be that the issue whether the defendant was a tenant should be referred to the Mamlatdar for decision and, after his decision is received by the civil court, if the issue is held against the defendant, the civil court may consider passing of a. decree. for eviction but if, on the other hand, he is held to be a tenant, the civil court may be required to dismiss the suit [pp. 1029 F H; 1030 A B; 1031 D E] Bhimaji Shankar Kulkam vs Dundappa Vithappa Udapudi & Anr., ; =. ; and Dhondi Tukaram vs Hari Dadu, AIR 1954 Bom. 100 = ILR , relied on. The impact of Fifth Amendment may give rise to a situation where a deemed tenant under s.4 of the Act is evicted from the land on or after 1st July, 1962; his remedy under s.8(2) is to approach the authority under the Act for recovery of possession of the land of which he has been disposed, and jurisdiction of the civil court stands wholly barred by virtue of s.58(2) of the Act as it would not be competent to pass any order for restoration of possession to the deemed tenant. If such a situation arises in a pending suit which was instituted in a competent court having jurisdiction at the date of its institution, it would be unfair to non suit the plaintiff altogether for no fault of his own and the proper course would be to follow in spirit the procedure outlined in Order 7, Rules 10 and 10A, C.P.C. [pp. 1031 F H; 1032 A B] 4. The High Court lacked jurisdiction to decide the question regarding tenancy on merits. Its order is set aside and the matter is remitted to 1019 the trial court to determine the course of action to be adopted in accordance with the guideline indicated hereinabove. [p. 1032 D F]"

The petitioners ' claim was resisted by the respondents. Their case was that the unit where the petitioners were working was a factory registered under the Factories Act, that they were treated as industrial workmen and given all benefits due to them under the various labour legislations, that the Government had not fixed the minimum wages payable to the workmen engaged in the Corporation or other like industries but the Corporation had adopted for its workmen the minimum wages payable for similar work in the construc tion industry, and that there were no regular employees of the petitioners ' categories in its establishment and, as such, the question of payment to them the pay admissible to regular employees does not arise. Dismissing the writ petition, HELD: 1. Unless it is shown that there is a discrimina tion amongst the same set of employees by the same master in the same establishment, the principle of \"equal pay for equal work\" cannot be enforced. A comparison cannot be made with counterparts in other establishments with different management, or even in establishments in different geograph ical location though owned by the same master.

(murder with common intention).\n* **Accused 5's Argument:** Prakash argued that the conviction for conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. was unsustainable because two persons are required for such an offense, and relied on a previous case (Topandas vs. State of Bombay) to support his argument.\n* **State's Argument:** The State argued that Prakash's conviction was valid, citing the evidence against him, including the bloodstained shirt, razor blade, and the approver's testimony.\n* **High Court's Decision:** The High Court dismissed the State's appeal and upheld the conviction of Prakash and Vinayak.\n* **Court's Decision:** The Supreme Court overturned the High Court's decision in relation to Prakash's conviction, finding that the High Court erred in relying on the retracted confession of accused 5. \n* **Prakash's Acquittal:** Prakash was acquitted and released.\n* **Vinayak's Conviction:** Vinayak's conviction was upheld, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\n\n**Key Evidence:**\n\n* **Bloodstained Razor Blade:** Found at the scene of the crime and linked to the victim.\n* **Bloodstained Shirt:** Found at Vinayak's house.\n* **Witness Testimony:**  Witnesses saw Vinayak near the crime scene.\n* **Medical Evidence:** The doctor's report indicated multiple injuries consistent with a sharp weapon.\n* **Approver's Testimony:** The approver, P.W. 1, implicated Vinayak in the crime.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned the High Court's decision in relation to Prakash's conviction, finding that the High Court erred in relying on the retracted confession of accused 5.

Charge No. 1 was for criminal conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. on the allegation that between first week of October, 1975 and 2nd January, 1976 at Babultara and Waghala villages all the seven accused and the approver P.W. 1 entered into a criminal conspiracy to commit murders of young girls and women in the vicinity of Babultara village by injuring the victims or disfiguring their faces in order to make it appear that the accused in an earlier case called the Manwath murders case where 10 girls and women were murdered during the period from 14.11.1972 to 4.11.1974 in Manwath village were not the real culprits. Charges 2 to 4 were framed under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. alleging that in furtherance of their common intention, accused 1 to 3 committed the murder of Ashamati on or about 10th November, 1975, accused 1 to 4 committed the murder of Parubai on or about 29th November, 1975 and accused 1, 6 and 7 committed the murder of Malan on or about 1st January, 1976. The Sessions Judge on a consideration of the evidence acquitted all the seven accused under charge No. 1; all the accused under charges 2 and 3 and accused 7 under charge No. 4, but convicted accused 1 and 6 under charge No. 4 and sentenced them to undergo imprisonment for life under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C.

        "reference": "The mode of proving a will does not ordinarily differ from that of proving any other document except as to the special requirement of attestation prescribed in the case of a will by section 63 of the Indian Succession Act. Proof in either case cannot be mathematically precise and certain and so the test should be one of satisfaction of a prudent mind in such matters. The onus must be on the propounder and in absence of suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of the will, proof of testamentary capacity and signature of the testator as required by law may be sufficient to discharge the onus. Where, however, there are suspicious circumstances, the onus would be on the propounder to explain them to the satis faction of the Court before the will can be accepted as genuine. If the caveator alleges undue influence, fraud or coercion the onus will be on him to prove the same. Where there are no such pleas but the circumstances give rise to such doubts, it is for the propounder to satisfy the conscience of the Court. What are suspicious circumstances must be judged in the facts and circumstances of each particular case. If the propounder takes a prominent part in the execution of the will which confers substantial benefits on him, that itself is a suspicious circumstance attending the execution of the will and in appreciating the evidence in such a case, the court should proceed with an open but nevertheless vigilant and cautious mind.

It appeared from the evidence that the appellant took a prominent, if not a decisive, part in the execution of the 427 will, which contained substantial bequests in favour of his sons.

Entry 4 occurs in a Schedule of taxable goods. When it was intended to confine an entry to particular gadgets and 'parts thereof ' the entry said so.

They also claimed that other states levied a lower royalty rate.\n    * **Discrimination:** They argued that the notification discriminated against them by granting a 50% royalty reduction to Parwana holders (individuals granted permission to extract minerals) and that this was a violation of Article 14 (equality before the law).\n    * **Arbitrary Levy:** They claimed the royalty was imposed arbitrarily and without any reasonable justification.\n    * **Freedom of Trade:** They argued that the royalty interfered with their freedom to trade and transport goods.\n* **Government's Arguments:**\n    * **Legitimate Authority:** The government argued that it had the authority to levy royalty under the Act and that the notification was valid.\n    * **Reasonable Classification:** They argued that the classification of Parwana holders and the royalty rates were reasonable and justified by the Act's purpose of regulating and developing minerals.\n    * **Social Policy:** They argued that the concession for Parwana holders was a social policy aimed at benefiting the weaker sections of society.\n    * **Constitutional Interpretation:** They argued that the Act and the Rules were not in conflict with Article 301 (freedom of trade) and Article 304 (restrictions on trade).\n\n**Court's Decision:**\n\n* The Supreme Court dismissed the petitions, finding the government's arguments to be valid.\n* The Court upheld the government's authority to levy royalty under the Act and the notification.\n* The Court found that the royalty rates were reasonable and justified by the Act's purpose of regulating and developing minerals.\n* The Court also found that the classification of Parwana holders and the royalty rates were reasonable and did not violate Article 14 (equality before the law).\n* The Court rejected the petitioners' arguments regarding the impact on freedom of trade and the constitutionality of the royalty.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The Supreme Court upheld the government's power to levy royalty on minor minerals, even if it resulted in a higher rate for some groups.\n* The Court emphasized the government's authority to make rules under the Act, even if they are not explicitly stated in the Act itself.\n* The Court found that the government's social policy of providing concessions to weaker sections of society was a legitimate justification for the royalty rates.\n\n\nThis case highlights the complex interplay between the government's power to regulate and develop resources, the rights of individuals, and the constitutional principles of equality and freedom of trade.",
        "reference": "The Petitioners in these petitions have challenged the validity of a Notification issued by the Government of Gujarat on June 25, 1985 whereby the Gujarat Minor Mineral Rules were amended with effect from 1.7.1985. By the said notification, original Rule 21 of the Rules was substituted by a new Rule 21 which provided that a holder of a quarry lease or any other mineral concession granted under the Rules shall pay royalty in respect of minor minerals provid ed in column 2 of the Schedule. It is under this Notifica tion that the rate of royalty in respect of Black trap and Hard Murrum was increased from Rs.4 to Rs. 7 per metric tonne. The validity of Rule 21 as it stood prior to its amend ment by the aforesaid impugned notification was considered and upheld by this Court on March 6, 1986 in D.K. Trivedi & Sons & Ors. vs State of Gujarat & Ors. , ; The impugned notification was issued at a time when the Writ Petitions in the aforesaid case were pending in the High Court. The increase in the levy of royalty effected by the impugned notification is now questioned in these petitions. The Petitioners raised the following contentions viz; (1) That the royalty levied and covered under the Rules should be applied only for mineral development and since the royalty is being treated as part of the consolidated fund of the State and used for other purposes by the State, the levy was bad; and (2) That the impugned notification in question was in contravention of clause (c) of article 304 of the constitution. (3) That the impugned notification is discriminatory in character. 407 Dismissing the Writ Petitions, this Court, HELD: That Act is no doubt passed for development of minerals but while discharging its functions relating to development, if the State incidentally allows mining to be carried on in the public interest and levies in that connec tion a tax, it does not mean that the said tax should be used only for development of minerals and not for other purposes sanctioned by law. [412B] The India Cement Ltd. etc. vs The State of Tamil Nadu etc., [1989] 4 SC Judgment Today 190. No restriction is being imposed on the freedom of trade of the petitioners by the levy of royalty. The minerals belong to the Government and if anybody wants to have the right as a lessee to exploit the mines to the exclusion of others and to remove the minerals with a view to making profit, he has to pay a royalty imposed in accordance with law. [412E] In the instant case, the levy is made under a law made by the Central Government. It is not an imposition made by a law made by the State Legislature on which alone, the re striction contemplated under article 304(b) applies. [412F] If the Executive or the administrative authority acts in an arbitrary manner, its action would be bad in law and liable to be struck down by the Courts but the possibility of abuse of power or arbitrary exercise of power cannot invalidate the statute conferring the power or the power which has been conferred by it. [413B C] Since the power exercised is legislative in character, the authority which is exercising the said power has the power to make Rules equitable by necessary implication. No express power need be conferred on such subordinate authori ty in order to make a classification for purposes of imple menting the policy of the Act under which the Rules are made. [415G]"

The appellant (the Sengunatha Mudaliar community) claims the temple's trusteeship is hereditary, while the respondents (the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner) argue it's not.\n* **The Issue:** The central question is whether the appellant is a \"hereditary trustee\" as defined by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act of 1951. The Act defines \"hereditary trustee\" as someone whose office is passed down by hereditary right, usage, or specifically laid out by the founder.\n\n**The Court's Reasoning:**\n\n* **The Act's Definition:** The court analyzes the definition of \"hereditary trustee\" in the Act, which includes three types:\n    * Succession by hereditary right.\n    * Succession regulated by usage.\n    * Succession specifically provided for by the founder.\n* **The Appellant's Argument:** The appellant argued that the trusteeship of the Kumaran Koil is regulated by usage, meaning the succession is determined by the community's custom.\n* **The Court's Refutation:** The court rejected this argument, stating that:\n    * \"Succession\" in the context of the Act implies a transfer of property or rights, not just a custom.\n    * The office of a trustee is considered property, and in the case of temples, it often follows the rules of inheritance.\n    * The election of trustees for a fixed term (one year) doesn't fit the definition of hereditary succession.\n    * The possibility of a trustee re-electing themselves is impossible, making it impossible to have a hereditary succession.\n* **The High Court's Decision:** The court dismissed the appeal, finding that the appellant is not a hereditary trustee as defined by the Act.\n\n**Key Legal Concepts:**\n\n* **Hereditary Trustee:** The court defines the concept of a hereditary trustee as someone whose office is passed down by a specific legal mechanism (hereditary right, usage, or founder's specific provision).\n* **Succession:** The court emphasizes that the definition of \"succession\" in the Act refers to the transfer of property or rights, not just a custom.\n* **Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act of 1951:** The court relies on this Act to interpret the definition of \"hereditary trustee\" and the rules of succession in Hindu temples.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe court's decision upholds the principle that the office of a trustee in a temple is not automatically hereditary, even if the community has a long-standing tradition of electing trustees. The court emphasizes that the Act's definition of \"hereditary trustee\" requires a specific legal mechanism for succession, which is not present in the case of the Kumaran Koil.",

The temple was rounded two hundred years ago by the members of the community and according to the usage of the temple, the trustees were elected for one year, at a meeting of the members of the community. On the question whether the appellant has a hereditary trustee, because he was, under section 6(9) of the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1951, the 'trustee of a religious institution succession to whose office is regulated by usage ', HELD: The phrase 'succession to whose office is regulated by usage ' would only apply when the ordinary rules of succession under the Hindu law are modified by usage, and succession has to be determined in accordance with the modified rules. The office of a hereditary trustee is in the nature of property. Succession in relation to property implies passing of an interest from one person to another. [428 C D] In the present case, the election to the office was for a fixed period of one year. In such a case, it is not possible to say there is a succession to the office, because: (a) on the efflux of the period for which one trustee is appointed, there is a vacancy and another is elected to that vacancy, and (b) since there is a possibility of the same trustee being reelected, an impossible legal position arises in which a person could be a successor of himself.

When the accused is going to lose his life in such a serious charge u/s 302 I.P.C. it is only necessary that the Court should be circumspect and closely scrutinise the evidence to come to an unhesitating conclusion that the sole single witness is absolutely reliable. [710G, H, 711H, 712A] (ii) In the instant case, the High Court was not correct in appreciating the ocular testimony of a sole witness, because (a) the very fact that the eye witness could be persuaded to substitute PWs. 1, 2. and 3 for his deceased brother as chasing the assailants, contrary to the version of the F.I.R. degrades him from the status of an absolutely reliable witness, not having a qualm of conscience, but an obliging and untrustworthy witness. [710H] (b) 'The version in the F.I.R. stands contradicted by the testimony in court on a very material point and does not corroborate. [712 B] (c ) Placing such reliance. therefore. as is requisite on the testimony of the uncorroborated solitary witness for convicting the accused facing a murder charge is not possible in the case.

His estate was carrying on his business after his death.\n* The income of the estate was assessed for the years 1950-1955.\n* The Income tax Officer sought to assess the income of the estate for these years, arguing that the income received by the heirs and legal representatives of Amarchand was taxable under section 24B of the Income tax Act.\n* The High Court of Bombay ruled against the Commissioner of Income tax, finding that the income received after Amarchand's death was not taxable under section 24B.\n\n**Key Arguments:**\n\n* **Commissioner of Income tax's Argument:**\n    * Section 24B of the Income tax Act allows for the assessment of the estate of a deceased person for income received during the previous year of death.\n    * The income received by the heirs and legal representatives after death should be considered as income received by Amarchand during his lifetime, and therefore taxable under section 24B.\n* **High Court's Argument:**\n    * Section 24B is limited to the income received by the deceased during his lifetime.\n    * The income received after death is not taxable under section 24B.\n    * Section 24B is a fiction created to ensure that the deceased person's estate is taxed on income received during his lifetime.\n    * The High Court relied on the principle that the deceased person is not a living entity after death and therefore cannot be assessed for income received after death.\n\n**Legal Reasoning:**\n\n* The document analyzes the legal provisions of section 24B of the Income tax Act and its application to the case.\n* It emphasizes that section 24B is intended to ensure that the deceased person's estate is taxed on income received during his lifetime.\n* The document also highlights the principle that legal fictions are only for a specific purpose and cannot be extended beyond that purpose.\n* The document concludes that the High Court's decision was correct and the appeals were dismissed.\n\n**Key Legal Concepts:**\n\n* **Section 24B of the Income tax Act:** This section deals with the assessment of the estate of a deceased person for income received during the previous year of death.\n* **Legal fiction:** A legal fiction is a legal concept that creates a situation that is not real but is used to achieve a legal result.\n* **Income tax liability:** The legal obligation to pay income tax.\n* **Estate of a deceased person:** The property and assets of a deceased person.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe document provides a comprehensive analysis of the legal arguments and rulings in the case, ultimately supporting the High Court's decision that the income received by the heirs and legal representatives of Amarchand after his death was not taxable under section 24B.",

Andhra Pradesh (1969)\n\nThis case concerns the constitutionality of the Andhra Pradesh government's policy of implementing \"Telengana Safeguards\" which aimed to restrict employment opportunities for non-domicile individuals in certain government positions within the Telengana region. \n\n**Background:**\n\n* The Andhra Pradesh government passed orders in 1969, aiming to implement \"Telengana Safeguards\" by relieving non-domicile employees from service and filling their positions with qualified domicile candidates.\n* The policy was based on the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957, which allowed Parliament to make laws regarding residence requirements for employment in specific areas.\n* The petitioners, ministerial employees in Andhra Pradesh, challenged the Act and the policy, arguing that it violated Article 16(3) of the Indian Constitution, which grants equality of opportunity in employment.\n\n**Key Arguments:**\n\n* **Petitioners' Argument:**\n    * Article 16(3) grants Parliament the power to make laws regarding residence requirements for employment in specific areas, but this power is limited to the whole State or Union Territory.\n    * The use of the word \"State\" in Article 16(3) should be interpreted narrowly, and the exception for residence within a State should not be extended to specific parts of the State.\n    * The policy is discriminatory and violates the principle of equality of opportunity.\n* **Respondent's Argument:**\n    * Parliament has the supreme power to make laws, including those regarding residence requirements.\n    * The words \"any requirement\" in Article 16(3) are broad enough to encompass any requirement, including residence in specific parts of the State.\n    * The exception in Article 16(3) allows for the inclusion of specific requirements, such as residence within a particular part of the State.\n\n**Court's Decision:**\n\n* The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the petitioners, declaring section 3 of the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957, and Rule 3 of the corresponding rules as ultra vires the Constitution.\n* The Court found that the use of the word \"State\" in Article 16(3) meant the entire State, not specific parts within it.\n* The Court rejected the respondent's argument that the words \"any requirement\" and \"any law\" in Article 16(3) allow for a broad interpretation, emphasizing that the words are controlled by the phrase \"residence within the State or Union territory.\"\n* The Court also rejected the argument that the Mulki Rules, existing in the former Hyderabad State, should continue to operate in the Telengana region.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* The Court quashed the orders passed by the Andhra Pradesh government and declared section 3 of the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957, and Rule 3 of the corresponding rules as ultra vires the Constitution.\n* The petitions were allowed, but no costs were awarded.\n\n\n**Significance:**\n\nThis case highlights the importance of interpreting constitutional provisions carefully and ensuring that they are not used to discriminate against individuals based on their place of residence. It also emphasizes the principle of equality of opportunity in employment and the limitations of Parliament's power to enact laws that may infringe upon fundamental rights.",

[122 A] Clause (3) of article 16 of the Constitution enables Parliament to make a law in a special case prescribing any requirement as to residence within a State or Union Territory prior to appointment, in the State or Union Territory. The provision speaks of a whole State as the venue for residential qualification and it is impossible to think that the Constituent Assembly was thinking of residence in Districts, Talukas, cities, towns or villages. The fact that the clause is an exception and came as an amendment must dictate that a narrow construction upon the exception should be placed as indeed the debates in the Constituent Assembly also seem to, indicate. The words 'any law ' and 'any requirement ' cannot be given wide and liberal construction.

Misra, a postman, for offenses under the Indian Post Office Act (1898) and the Indian Penal Code. \n* **The Allegations:** The prosecution alleged that Misra stole or secreted five registered letters and fabricated receipts to cover up his actions.\n* **The Defense:** Misra argued that he was not in possession of the letters and that the prosecution's case was based on circumstantial evidence. He claimed that the letters were planted by the opposing party.\n\n**Key Points of the Judgment:**\n\n* **The High Court's Decision:** The High Court of Allahabad convicted Misra on all charges, finding that he had secreted the letters.\n* **The Supreme Court's Decision:** The Supreme Court overturned the High Court's decision, finding that the prosecution failed to prove that Misra had secreted the letters.\n* **The Supreme Court's Reasoning:**\n    * **Possession:** The Supreme Court found that the prosecution failed to establish that the almirah containing the letters was in Misra's exclusive possession. The key to the almirah was produced by his father, and the almirah contained other items belonging to his father.\n    * **Entrustment:** The Supreme Court emphasized that the prosecution did not establish that Misra had been entrusted with the letters, which is a key element in proving theft under the Indian Post Office Act.\n    * **Circumstantial Evidence:** The Supreme Court rejected the High Court's reliance on circumstantial evidence to convict Misra.\n    * **Presumption of Joint Possession:** The Supreme Court found that the prosecution's argument that the almirah was in Misra's exclusive possession was based on a flawed presumption.\n    * **Opportunity vs. Exclusive Possession:** The Supreme Court distinguished between the opportunity to obtain the letters and the actual possession of the letters. \n\n**Outcome:**\n\nThe Supreme Court allowed the appeals and set aside the convictions and sentences against Misra.\n\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision highlights the importance of establishing clear and convincing evidence of possession and entrustment in criminal cases, particularly those related to theft and the Indian Post Office Act. The case also emphasizes the need to distinguish between circumstantial evidence and direct evidence.",
        "reference": "The appellant, a postman, and I,is father were living in the same house. Certain undelivered postal articles were re covered from an almirah in the house, the key of which was produced by the father. The appellant was tried and convicted of an offence under section 52 Post Offices Act for secreting postal articles. The appellant contended that since it had not been proved that he had been entrusted with these articles the offence under section 52 was not made out and that lie could not be held guilty of secreting as he was not in exclusive possession of these articles. Held, that entrustment was not an essential ingredient of the offence under section 52. Where the legislature intended to make entrustment an ingredient of the offence it had used appropriate words to make it clear. It had used no such words in section 52. To secrete means to hide. In a case like the present, the retention of an undelivered postal article in an almirah for an inordinately long period would be tantamount to hiding that article. Held, further, that the appellant was not in exclusive possession of the postal articles and no inference could be drawn 409 that he had secreted them. As the key was produced by the appellant 's father it could not be inferred that the appellant was in joint possession of the almirah much less that he was in exclusive possession of it. No inference could be drawn from the fact that the almirah contained certain other articles belonging to the appellant as it also contained a large number of articles belonging to the father."

However, the, Panchayat did not allow his application and proceeded (to hold M and others guilty and imposing fines on them. M, thereafter filed an application under sections 4 and 5 of the , alleging contempt of the High Court by the Panchayat. An affidavit filed before the High Court by the Sarpanch stated that the document filed by M, by way of an affidavit in support of his application had not been verified by any proper authority and for this and other reasons the Panchayat did not believe that the High Court had stayed the proceedings. The High Court held the members of the Panchayat guilty of contempt and observed that if they wanted to ascertain the matter, they should have at best stayed the proceedings for a short while and asked the applicant to produce a certified copy of the stay order; in not doing so, the Panchas had obviously not acted bona fide and their action amounted to, wilful disobedience of the High Court 's order. On appeal to this Court, HELD : The appeal must be allowed and the judgment and order of the High Court set aside. The only material before the Panchayat was the application dated December 25. 1963, which was not supported by 'any affidavit sworn to before a person authorised to administer oaths. Further, the application did not contain the date of the order; even a copy of the telegram stated to have been sent by M 's advocate in the High Court was not attached to the application. On this material the bona fides of the Panchas could not be doubted if they refused to accept the mere statement of the party that the High Court had stayed the proceedings before them. In such matters those who assert that a person had knowledge of the order must prove this fact beyond all reasonable doubt.

The Court reasoned that Ujagar Singh's presence on the field was plausible given the time of year and the presence of neel gais, which damage crops.\n* **Support for Ujagar Singh's Statement:** The Court found that Ujagar Singh's statement was supported by other witnesses, including Paley Singh and Bishram Singh, who corroborated his account of Ram Singh's confession and his subsequent visit to the police station.\n* **Evidence Supporting the Confession:** The Court highlighted the evidence of Ram Singh's purchase of a sword, its subsequent discovery stained with blood, and his delivery of the sword to the police station. These facts, the Court argued, provided strong support for the confession.\n* **Conviction and Sentence:** The Supreme Court concluded that the evidence presented by the prosecution, including the confession, the purchase of the sword, and the presence of the sword at the scene, was sufficient to establish Ram Singh's guilt. The Court therefore dismissed the appeal and upheld the conviction and sentence.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe Supreme Court found that the prosecution's evidence, including the confession, the purchase of the sword, and the presence of the sword at the scene, was sufficient to establish Ram Singh's guilt.

Evidence was also led of an extra judicial confession made by the appellant to one U but the High Court did not place reliance on it as it did not feel sure of it though it observed that a perusal of the statement of U showed that it was very likely that what he stated may have happened. ^ Held, that the statement of U regarding the extra judicial confession was erroneously rejected by the High Court. Extra judicial confessions were not usually considered with favour but such a confession coming from a person who had no reason to state falsely and to whom it was made in circumstances which tended to support his statement could be relied upon.

A period of 30 days was however actually provided in the rule. The final publication of the electoral roll was made on November 16, .1978. After November 25, 1978 a large number of nominations were received by the Returning officer arid the final list of candidates for the elections with their symbols was published on December 20, 1978 and the poll took place on December 31, 1978. The appellants (Petitioners 1, 5 and 6) along with some others in their writ petition filed on December 28, 1978 contended that the entire election process had become vitiated on account of the defect in the notice issued by the Collector under Rule 4 (1) providing 20 days for preferring claims and objections while the rule prescribed 30 days and that by non compliance with this mandatory requirement, the entire election process held on the basis of the defective electoral roll, became a nullity and therefore the declaration of results of the successful candidates was liable to be quashed. The High Court held that the appellants were not entitled to any relief as they had approached the Court after undue delay. Dismissing the appeals this Court, ^ HELD: 1. It is well settled that the power of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution to issue an appropriate writ is discretionary and if the High Court finds that there is no satisfactory explanation for the inordinate delay, it may reject the petition if it finds that the issue of writ will lead to public inconvenience and interference with rights of others. This rule applies also to a case in which the validity of an election to a local authority is challenged. The question whether in a given case. the delay involved . is such that it dissentients a person to relief . under article 226 is a matter within the discretion of the High Court which as in all matters of 492 discretion has to exercise it judiciously and reasonably having regard to The surrounding circumstances.

However, the Court found that this principle does not apply to section 134 of the Indian Act.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, finding that the directors were not liable under section 134 of the Companies Act, 1913. \n* The Court acknowledged that the directors might have been guilty of other offenses under sections 76 and 133, but not under section 134.\n\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of clear and unambiguous language in legal provisions.\n* The Court rejected the argument that a company's failure to hold a general meeting could excuse its failure to comply with the requirements of section 134.\n* The Court's decision reinforces the importance of adhering to the specific requirements of each section of the Companies Act.",
        "reference": "Section 220 of the , which corresponds to section 134 of the 1913 Act, provides that within thirty days after the balance sheet and profit and loss account, as the case may be, have been laid before the company at the general meeting. three copies thereof shall be filed with the registrar and that failure to do so is punishable. The respondent company and its directors were prosecuted for failure to file with the Registrar of Companies on or before 30th October 1967, the Balance sheet and profit and loss account of the company. By 30th September, 1967, admittedly, no general body meeting had been held. The High Court held that since no general body meeting was held, there could be no question of laying the balance sheet before the general body meeting and complying with the requirements of the section; and that, though the willful omission to call a general body meeting and of laying the balance sheet and profit and loss account before it may expose the persons responsible to punishment under other provisions of the Act, it would not make them liable either under section 134(4) of the 1913 Act or section 220 of the 1956 Act. Dismissing the appeal to this Court, HELD : On principle and authority it should be held that no offence was committed under section 220 of the . [417B] (a) The principle accepted by this Court in State of Bombay vs Bandhan Ram Bhandani [1961] 1 S.C.R_ 801, that a company or its directors in a prosecution under sections 32 and 133 of the 1913 Act, could not, in defence to such prosecution, rely upon their own failure to call the general body meeting would not apply to a prosecution under section 134 of the 1913 Act or section 220 of the 1956 Act. Unlike sections 32 and 133, the responsibility of I sending to the Registrar the copies of the balance sheet and profit and loss account arises only after they have been laid before the company at the general meeting, the obligation to do so being completely dependent on its being laid before a general meeting. [414H 415E] (b) Where the words in the section are clear it is unnecessary to consider whether it embodies any principle and whether that principle is consistent with the principle as embodied in other sections which are differently worded. In interpreting a penal provision it is not permissible to give an extended meaning to the plain words of the section on the ground of a principle recognised in certain other provisions. [415F G] (c) This is not a case where an accused person relies on his default and pleads his innocence. In the , various stages have to be gone through before we reach the stage of a copy of the balance sheet and the profit and loss account being filed with the Registrar. The failure to reach any one of the stages within the time prescribed is made penal by the Act. The respondents may be guilty of any of those offences but not of the offence with which they were charged. [416E G] (d) Further a daily penalty is provided after the thirtieth day mentioned in section 220 (1) of the 1956 Act. When no general body meeting was held it is not possible to calculate the period of 30 days and there would be diffi culty in working Cut he daily penalty.

        "reference": "The West Bengal Special Courts Act (X of 1950) was entitled \"An Act to provide for the speedier trial of cer tain offences,\" and the object of the Act. as declared in the preamble, was \"to provide for the speedier trial of certain offences\". Section 3 of the Act empowered the State Government by notification in the official gazette to con stitute Special Courts, and sec. 5 provided that \"A Special Court shall try such offences or classes of offences or cases or classes of cases, as the State Government may by general or special order in writing, direct. \" The Act laid down a procedure for trial before Special Courts which was different in several respects from that laid down by the Criminal Procedure Code for trial of offences generally. The respondent, who was convicted by a Special Court which tried his case under a notification issued by the Government under sec. 5, contended that the said section was unconsti tutional and void inasmuch as it contravened article 14 of the Constitution, which provides that \"the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protec tion of the laws within the territory of India\". 285 Held, per FAZL ALl, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA, CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR and BOsE JJ. (PATANJALI SASTRI C.J., dissenting) Section 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950, contravenes article 14 of the Constitution and is void inasmuch as (per FAZL ALl, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA, and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ.) the procedure laid down by the Act for the trial by the Special Courts varied substantially from that laid down for the trial of offences generally by the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Act did not classify, or lay down any basis for classification, of the cases which may be directed to be tried by the Special Court, but left it to the uncontrolled discretion of the State Government to direct any case which it liked to be tried by the Special Court. DAs J. Section 5 Il) of the Act, in so far as it empowered the State Government to direct \"offences\" or \"classes of offences\" or \"classes of cases\" to be tried by a Special Court, does not confer an uncontrolled and unguided power on the State Government but by necessary implication contemplates a proper classification and is not void. That part of the section which empowered the Government to direct \"cases\" as distinct from \"classes of cases\" to be tried by a Special Court is void. PATANJALI SASTRI C.J. Section 5 (1) of the Act is not void or unconstitutional wholly or even in part. Per FAZL ALl, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ. A rule of procedure laid down by law comes as much within the purview of article 14 of the Constitution as any rule of substantive law and it is necessary that all litigants, who are similarly situated, are able to avail themselves of the same procedural rights for rebel and for defence with like protection and without discrimination. (ii) If it is established that the person complaining has been discriminated against as a result of legislation and denied equal privileges with others occupying the same position, it is not incumbent upon him before he can claim relief on the basis of fundamental rights to assert and prove that, in making the law, the legislature was actuated by a hostile or inimical intention against a particular person or class ; nor would the operation of article 14 be excluded merely because it is proved that the legislature had no intention to discriminate, though discrimination was the necessary consequence of the Act. The question of intention may arise in ascertaining whether an officer acted mala fide or not; but it cannot arise when discrimination follows or arises on the express terms of the law itself. (iii) The language of sec. 5 (1) clearly and unambigu ously vests the State Government with unrestricted discre tion to direct any cases or class of cases to be tried by the Special Court, not a discretion to refer cases only when it is of opinion that a speedier trial is necessary 286 (iv) Assuming that the preamble throws any light on the section, the necessity of speedier trial is too vague, uncertain and elusive a criterion to form a rational basis for discrimination. (v) It cannot be said that an Act does not contravene the equality rule laid down by article 14 simply because it confers unregulated discretion on officers or administrative bodies. The true position is that if the statute itself is not discriminatory the charge of Violation of the article may be only against the official who administers it, but if the statute itself makes a discrimination without any proper or reasonable basis, it would be void for being in conflict with article 14. (vi) The notification issued under the Act in the present case would also come within the definition of law and could be impeached apart from the Act if it violates article 14. DAS J. (1) Article 14 does not insist that every piece of legislation must have universal application and it does not take away from the State the power to classify persons for the purposes of legislation, but the classification must be rational, and in order to satisfy this test (i) the classification must be founded on an intelligible differen tia which distinguished those that are grouped together from others, and (ii) that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act. The differentia which is the basis of the classification and the object of the Act are distinct things and what is necessary is that there must be a nexus between them. But the mere fact that the inequality has not been made with the special intention of prejudicing a particular person or persons but in the general interest of administration will not validate a law if in fact it results in inequality of treatment. Nor can the constitutionality of a statute depend on the degree of the inequality brought about by the law. (2) Although the preamble to an Act cannot override the plain meaning of its operative parts, it may nevertheless assist in ascertaining what the true meaning or implication of a particular section is; and the part of sec. 5 ( 1 ) of the Act which relates to \"offences ' ', \"Classes of offences\" and \"classes of cases\", construed in the light of the pream ble, does not confer an uncontrolled and unguided power on the State Government, but by necessary implication and intendment empowers the State to classify the offences or classes of offences or classes of cases, that is to say, to make a proper classification having a relation to the object of the Act as recited in the preamble; and this part of sec. 5 (1) foes not therefore contravene article 14. (3) That part of sec. 5(1) which empowers the State Government to direct \"cases\" as distinct from \"classes of cases\" to be cried by the Special Court lies beyond the ambit of the object aid down by the preamble and contem plates and involves a purely arbitrary selection based on nothing more substantial 287 than the whim and pleasure of the State Government without any appreciable relation to the necessity for a speedier trial and therefore offends against the provisions of article 14 and is void. Bose J. The test under article 14 is neither classifica tion nor whether there is absolute equality in any academi cal sense of the term but whether the collective conscience of a sovereign democratic republic as reflected in the views of fair minded, reasonable, unbiassed men, who are not swayed by emotion or prejudice, can consider the impugned laws as reasonable, just and fair and regard them as that equal treatment and protection in the defence of liberties which is expected of a sovereign democratic republic in the conditions which obtain in India to day. PATANJALI SASTRI C.J. (dissenting). Section 5 (1) of the impugned Act is not void or unconstitutional wholly or even in part because: (1)The words in the enacting part of a statute must be confined to that which is the plain object and general intention of the legislature in passing the Act and the preamble affords a good clue to discover what that object was. The title and the preamble of the Act in the present case show unmistakably that the whole object and purpose of the Act was to devise machinery for the speedier trial of certain offences. The discretion intended to be exercised by the State Government must be exercised bona fide on a consideration of the special features or circum stances which call for comparatively prompt disposal of a case or cases proposed to be referred and sec. 5 (11 must be read as empowering the Government to direct the Special Court to try such offences or classes of offences or cases or classes of cases as in its judgment, require speedier trial. (2) Article 14 of the Constitution does not mean that all laws must be general in character and universal in application. The State must possess the power of distin guishing and classifying persons or things to be subjected to particular laws and in making a classification the legis lature must be allowed a wide latitude of discretion and judgment. The classification is justified if it is not palpably arbitrary but is founded on a reasonable basis having regard to the object to be attained. The powers of the legislature must include the power of entrusting an administrative body With a plenary but not arbitrary discre tion to be exercised so as to carry out the purpose of the Act and the mere fact that the discretion might be exercised arbitrarily by the administrative body cannot make the law itself unconstitutional. (4)The impugned Act does not in terms or by implication discriminate between persons or classes of persons nor does it purport to deny to any one equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws. (5) Even from the point of view of reasonable classification the expediency of speedier trial is not too vague or indefi nite to be the basis of classification. (6) The notifica tion of the Government in the present case referring the case to the Special Court did not contravene article 14 and is not void inasmuch as there is nothing 288 to show that the Government was influenced by any discrimi natory motive or design or acted arbitrarily, but on the other hand there are obviously special features which mark off the group of cases referred as requiring speedier dis posal.

        "reference": "In pursuance of r. 7A(1)(b) of the Central Health Service Rules, 1963 as amended by the Central Health Service (Amendment) Rules. 1966 and all other powers enabling in that behalf, the President of India issued a notification dated. June 8,1967 making the substantive appointment of the appellant Dr. Asim Kumar Bose as Radiologist, Irwin Hospital, New Delhi. By virtue of his post as Radiologist cum Associate Professor of Radiology, the appellant was teaching the under graduate and post graduate students as an Associate Professor of Radiology of the Maulana Azad Medical College for the M.D., M.S., D.M.R.T. And M B.B.S. courses of studies of the Delhi University. In 1973 the Central Government promoted Dr. K.P. Mittal, Lecturer in Radiology in the Maulana Azad Medical College as Associate Professor of Radiotherapy ignoring the claim of the appellant who thereupon made a representation. The Government of India, Ministry of Health & family Planning Department of Health by its letter dated February 23, 1974 rejected the representation holding that the appellant could not be considered for appointment to the post of Associate Professor of Radiotherapy in the Maulana Azad Medical College inasmuch as he did not possess at least five years ' teaching experience as Reader/Assistant Professor in the concerned speciality as required under r. 8(2A) and paragraph 3 of Annexure I to the Second Schedule of the 1966 Rules. The appellant filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court challenging the impugned order, but the High Court rejected the writ petition holding that the requirement rules required that the requisite teaching experience must be the experience gained while working in a medical college or in a teaching institution i.e. as a Teacher in a teaching department. Allowing the appeal. ^ HELD: (1) There was a failure on the part of the Government of India in the Ministry of Health to draw a distinction between teaching and non 17 teaching hospitals under the Central Health Service. The Irwin Hospital and the G.B. Pant Hospital are the two associate hospitals of the Maulana Azad Medical College and the teaching in the medical college is undertaken by Professors and Associate Professors as well as by the Specialists attached to the two hospitals affiliated to the College. Thus the teaching experience gained by the appellant while holding the post of Radiologist cum Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) had to be taken into consideration to determine his eligibility for appointment as Professor or Associate Professor of the concerned speciality. [35 G H, 36 A C, 43 F G] (2) On a construction of r. 8(2) and paragraph 2(b) of Annexure 1 to the Second Schedule of the 1966 Rules, it was held that the appellant possessed the qualifications and experience requisite for appointment to the post of Professor of Radiotherapy in the Maulana Azad Medical College which is a post belonging to Specialist Grade I equivalent to Supertime Grade II carrying a pay scale of Rs. 1800 2250, which had fallen vacant during the pendency of the appeal. The Union Public Service Commission must therefore re advertise the post of Professor and call the appellant for an interview for being considered for appointment to the post. [38 C D, F H] (3) The action of the Central Government in the Ministry of Health ignoring the claim of the appellant for appointment to the post of Associate Professor of Radiotherapy in the Maulana Azad Medical College in 1973 was based on a misconstruction of r. B(2A) and paragraph 3 of Annexure I to the Second Schedule. The word \"as\" in these provisions must, in the context in which it appears, be interpreted to mean \"in the capacity of\". These provisions must be interpreted in a broad and liberal sense as it would otherwise work great injustice of persons in Specialists Grade II like the appellant who, while holding a non clinical post in a teaching hospital like the Irwin Hospital, has actually been teaching the students of the Maulana Azad Medical College to which it is affiliated. The Ministry of Health cannot be heard to say that the appellant had not acquired the status of an Associate Professor of Radiology with effect from October 9, 1964, particularly when the Central Government have been utilizing his services as such for teaching the post graduate and under graduate students of the Maulana Azad Medical College for the M.D., M.S., D.M.R.T. and M.B.B.S. courses of studies for the last 17 years. The arrangement has continued for all these years with the approval of the Delhi University which has conferred the designation of Associate Professor of Radiology on the appellant presumably with the tacit sanction of the Medical Council of India. [37 F G, 38 A B, 42 D F] (4) The recruitment rules nowhere provide that the teaching experience gained by a Specialist in a teaching hospital in the capacity of an Associate Professor (ex officio) shall not count towards the requisite teaching experience for purposes of sub rs. (2) and (2A) of r. 8 and paragraph 2 (b) and 3 of Annexure I to the Second Schedule of the 1966 Rules. There is no provision made in the Rules that the teaching experience must be gained on a regular appointment. There is hardly any difference so far as teaching experience is concerned whether it is acquired on regular appointment or as a Specialist in a teaching hospital with the ex officio designation. As the statutory rules do not 18 provide that the teaching experience gained in an ex officio capacity shall not count towards the requisite teaching experience, the teaching experience gained by the appellant while holding the post of Radiologist cum Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) in the Irwin Hospital can not be ignored in determining his eligibility for appointment as Professor or Associate Professor of the concerned speciality.

(OPML) in Brajrajnagar, Orissa, had a dispute with its workers regarding minimum wages.\n* The Industrial Tribunal was tasked with adjudicating the dispute and issued an award.\n* The workers appealed the Tribunal's award to the Supreme Court.\n\n**Key Issues:**\n\n* **Minimum Wage Calculation:** The Supreme Court reviewed the Tribunal's decision on how to calculate minimum wages. The Tribunal had:\n    *  Used a different basis for calculating minimum wages compared to the company's practice.\n    *  Used a different basis for calculating the minimum wage than the company's practice.\n* **Comparison with Other Industries:** The Tribunal compared the wages of OPML with those of other paper mills in the region, but the Supreme Court found this comparison flawed.\n* **Bonus Calculation:** The Supreme Court also reviewed the Tribunal's decision on bonus payments.

The Tribunal held: (1 ) that there were in the region no ' other concerns in the same line of business which could be compared with the respondent but that there were three collieries, a steel plant, a cement factory and an aluminum company in the region which were comparable with the resportdent, that as the minimum wage in those industries which was about Rs. 95 was above that of the respondent, a revision of the minimum wage in the respondent mills was justified. that such minimum wage should be fixed for the price index prevailing at the time of the award taking 100 as the basic index for the year 1939, and that on that basis, the basic wage and dearness allowance should be Pa. 73, and that Pa. 11 was payable as production bonus; (2) that the dearness allowance element need not be linked to the price index, but that wage should be fixed at the prevailing price index leaving it to the workmen to ask for increase in minimum wage on any further rise in price index; (3 ) that the revised wages were payable with effect from 13th December, 1962; (4) that the three elements of basic wage, dearness allowance, and production bonus which make up the total minimum wage packet of Rs. 84 (Rs. 73 + Pa. 11) should be in the proportion of 3: 3: 1, and that profit bonus was payable at three months ' basic wage. The proportion of 3:3: 1 was fixed by the Tribunal, because, under an agreement of 1959 the management and workmen accepted that proportion by mutual consent. On the basis of that agreement, the Tribunal also held that; (5) casual workers should not be equated to permanent workers for purpose of minimum wages, and that casual and radii workers should not be allowed bonus on the same basis as the permanent workers; (6) The appellants also claimed before the Tribunal 6 months ' basic wage instead of 3 months ' basic wage, which was being paid by the respondent, on the assumption that certain before staff were being paid as bonus 3 months ' consolidated wage consisting of basic wage and dearness allowance; but the Tribunal rejected the claim. In appeal to this Court. HELD: (1) This Court laid down in French Motor Car Co. Ltd. vs Its Workmen, [1963] Supp. that where there is no concern in the same industry in the region comparable with the concern in which wages have to be fixed, greater emphasis should be laid on the region part of the industry cum region principle. To give full effect to this rule the Tribunal should have proceeded to fix the minimum wage in the respondent mills on the basis of the average minimum wage prevailing 667 in the other industries in that region. The respondent was not providing any amenities which should be taken into account in fixing the minimum wage, different from the amenities provided by those concerns in the region which were being compared. Therefore, the Tribunal should have fixed the minimum wage packet at Rs. 95 per mensem which was the average wage prevailing in all those concerns and should not have fixed the wages on an entirely different basis. [671 F H; 672 G H] (2) The Industrial, Tribunal has the discretion, in appropriate cases, of making a direction linking the dearness allowance element of a wage to the price index, or to fix the wage at the prevailing price index leaving the labour to raise a fresh demand and, if necessary, a fresh industrial dispute for further rise in wages, in case there is marked variation in price index and the wage fixed becomes outdated; and therefore. the Tribunal was not wrong in choosing the latter alternative. [674 F G; 675 B] Hydra (Engineers), vs The Workmen, ; , referred (3) This direction ' was objected to by respondents, on the ground that the respondent may have to pay arrears for 5 or 6 years which would be a heavy burden. But the previous agreement of 1959 was binding only upto 12th December, 1962. So, the Tribunal was right in directing that the revised wages should take effect from 13th December, 1962, in view of the considerable rise in the price index and the fact that the labour had not raised a fresh dispute for a further revision of wages since the date of the award. [675 G H] (4) No error was committed by the Tribunal in the break up of the wages into the 3 elements of basic wage, dearness allowance and production bonus in the proportion of 3: 3: 1. The contention of the workmen that the proportion should be 3:1: 1: so as to increase the basic wage element and consequently the profit bonus. was rightly rejected by the Tribunal, because. the proportion of 3:3:1 was accepted by mutual consent. [674 B C] (5) The distinction between casual workers and permanent workers for purpose of minimum wage, and casual and badli workers on the hand and permanent workers on the other for purpose of bonus, was recognised by the parties themselves in the agreement of 1959, and therefore, the Tribunal was right in keeping up the distinction in its award. [675 D E; 678 B C] (6) The allegation that some clerical staff was receiving what amounted to 6 months ' basic wage as bonus was incorrect. There was some clerical staff which did not get any dearness allowance and the bonus in their case was worked out on the basis of their wages which was only the basic wage. The appellants were wrong in assuming that the wage of such clerical staff was a consolidated wage consisting of the 2 elements of basic wage and dearness allowance. Therefore, the appellants could not claim 3 months ' consolidated wages as bonus which would amount to 6 months ' basic wage. [677 G H; 678 A B] It could not be urged by the appellants that calculation of available. surplus for purposes of bonus should have been on the basis of the Full Bench formula approved by this Court in Associated Cement Companies Ltd. vs Its Workmen, , for justifying 6 months ' basic wages as bonus, because, that was not the basis of the claim before the Tribunal. Further, the Tribunal was expected to decide the dispute only as referred to it, and at the time of the reference the accounts for the years 1962 63 and 1963 64 could not have been available, and therefore, 668 there could not possibly be a claim for higher bonus on the basis of the application of the Full Bench Formula.

The notice was therefore invalid, and the court set it aside.",
        "reference": "The appellant, a partnership firm, filed its return of income for the assessment year i960 61 and subsequently produced before the Incometax Officer its relevant books of accounts and papers. It also produced before him the statement showing various creditors from whom it had borrowed on Hundis during the accounting year in question, giving full names and addresses of the alleged creditors. After enquiry the Incometax Officer made an assessment. On June 3, 1966 the Income tax Officer issued to the appellant a notice under section 148 of the Income tax Act, 1961. The notice was issued after four years but before 8 years of the end of the original assessment year. The appellant challenged the validity of the notice as well as the proceedings taken on the strength of that notice in a writ petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. The High Court dismissed the petition. By special leave appeal was filed in this Court. On direction given by the Court the report submitted by the Income tax Officer to the Commissioner and the Commissioner 's order thereon were produced. In the report it was said that it appeared that the alleged creditors of the appellant were name lenders and transactions were bogus; hence proper investigation regarding those loans was necessary. Question No. 8 on the report was whether the Commissioner was satisfied that the case was fit for the issue of notice under section 148. Against this the commissioner had noted 'yes '. On these facts this Court, HELD : Under section 148 and section 151(2) the Income tax Officer Must record his reasons for issuing the notice under section 148. There must be prima facie grounds for taking action under section 148 Further before issuing such a notice the provisions of cis. (a) and (b) of section 147 must be satisfied. [447 B, E] In this case the Income tax Officer appears to have had a vague feeling that the transactions were bogus and that the alleged creditors were only name lenders. According to him proper investigation regarding the loans was necessary. That is not the same thing as saying that there ,are reasons to issue notice under section 148. [447 A C] In these circumstances it could not be held that the Income tax Officer had any material before him which could satisfy the requirements of either cl. (a) or cl. (b) of section 147. Therefore he could not have issued a notice under section 148. Further the report submitted by him under section 151(2) did not mention any reason for coming to the conclusion that it was a fit case for the issue of the notice under section 148. The Commissioner also mechanically accorded permission. Thus the important safeguards provided in sections 147 and 151 were lightly treated by the income tax Officer as well as by the Commissioner. [447 F 448 B] The appeal must accordingly be allowed."

        "reference": "By section 25 (4) of the Income tax Act, \"Where the person who was at the commencement of the Indian Income tax (Amendment) Act, 1939. carrying on any business, profession or vocation in which tax was at any time charged under the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act, 1918, is succeeded in such capacity by another person, the change not being merely a change in the constitution of a partnership, no tax shall be payable by the first mentioned person in respect of the income, profits and gains of the period between the end of the previous year and the date of such succession.\" A firm bearing the same name as the appellant firm, had been carrying on business from before 1918 and had paid tax on that business under the Income tax Act, 1918. The firm did three kinds of businesses, namely, (a) in piece goods, yam as general merchants, 92 (b) in the manufacture and sale of umbrellas and (c) in the manufacture and sale of soaps. There were various changes in the constitution of the firm between 1918 and 1934. In May 1939 two, documents were executed, one by the then members of the firm, and a stranger H. being exhibit CI and the other by those members alone,. being exhibit CII. It appeared from exhibit CI that the business in the manufacture and sale of umbrellas and soaps was being carried on from October November 1937 by the parties to it as partners while exhibit CII showed that the parties to it had been carrying on the business in yarn piecegoods and as general merchants as partners from the same time as mentioned in exhibit Cl. On October 30. 1943 a document styled as an agreement of partnership was executed by five persons who were then the persons interested in the businesses carried on under the instrument of May 30, 1939. This document referred to the two, agreements of partnership of May 30, 1939 and certain subsequent retirements of partners and admissions of new partners and provided that the businesses previously carried on by the two partnerships. referred to in the instruments of May 30, 1939, would thereafter be carried on by one single partnership constituted by the parties to it. Thereafter all the businesses aforesaid were carried on by this single partnership. The firm constituted by the instrument of October 30, 1943 continued with certain changes in its constitution till February 7, 1948 when the then partners of, it entered into an agreement with a company to transfer the business of the firm to the latter, the transfer to be completed by February 13, 1948 and the transfer was in fact made. The firm constituted by the document of October 30, 1943 claimed relief under section 25(4) in assessment for the years 1948 49 and 1949 50 on the ground that it had been carrying on a business on April 1, 1939 when the Income tax (Amendment) Act, 1939 commenced; to operate on which business tax had been charged under the Act of 1918 and that it was succeeded in that business by a company in February 1948. Held: (per Sarkar and Shah JJ.). The assessee was not entitled to the relief. Cl and CII showed that the business that had been carried on by the firm existing in 1918 was discontinued in October/November 1937 and its businesses were split up into two and from then carried on by two independent partnerships brought into existence by those documents. The old firm was brought to an end by Exs. Cl and CII. When a business carried on in one unit is disintegrated and divided into parts, the parts are not the whole, though all the parts taken together constitute the whole. In such case there is a discontinuance of the original businesses. section N. A. section A. Annamalai, Chettiar vs Commissioner of Income tax, Madras, referred to. 93 The business on which tax had been charged under the Act of 1918 was not being carried on April 1, 1939 by the firm which had paid tax under that Act. The business to which the company succeeded under the agreement ,of February 7, 1948 cannot before the succession be said to have been carried on by a firm which was carrying on business on April 1, 1939, for that firm had been newly formed under the instrument of ,October 30, 1943, which expressly revoked the partnership agreements of May 30, 1939 under which two firms had been brought into brought into existence. Per, Hidayatullah J. (dissenting) (i) Sub sections (3) and (4) of section 25 ,of the Act are mutually exclusive . sub section (3) was only applicable when the business was discontinued and that in the term \"succession\" was not to be included a change in the constitution of the partnership. In sub section (4) the emphasis is on succession to a person who on April 1, 1939 was carrying on any business on which tax was at any time ,charged under the Act 1918. In sub section (3) the emphasis is on the discontinuance of the business which had paid tax under the Act 1918. (ii) There is difference of approach to the same facts under the law of partnership and the Income tax law. Charandas vs Haridas, (1960)39 and Dulichand vs ,Commissioner of Income tax, Nagpur, [1956] S.C.R. 154, referred to. (iii) Discontinuance of a firm is not a mere change in the constitution of the firm or even succession where, though the business changes hands, the original business which paid the tax in 1918 is carried on. Shivram Poddar vs Income tax, Officer, C. A. No. 455 of 1963 dated December 13, 1963, referred to. (iv) All cases of discontinuance of businesses are treated under sub section (3) and all cases of succession under sub section (4) and all cases of mere change in the constitution of the firm are neither cases under sub section (3) nor under sub section These sub sections do not apply to cases where the business was not in existence before the Act 1922 came into force. Ambalal Himatlal vs Commissioner of Income tax and Excess Profits Tax, Bombay North, , referred to. (v) Since the soap and umbrella businesses were not in existence and no relief could be claimed in respect of these businesses, changes in respect of them were irrelevant. (vi) by the expression \"discontinued\" in sub section (3) is meant complete cessation of business. In the present case it could be said that this had taken place in respect of the piece goods business; this might 94 have been managed by persons other than those who had paid the tax under the 1918 Act, but the business was not discontinued for the application of sub section Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs P. E. Polson, (1945)13 Commissioner of Income tax, West Bengal vs A. W. Figgies and Co. ; and Mevoppar vs Commissioner of Income tax, Madras, 1. L. R. referred to. (vii) In the present case there was no succession and it falls within the rule laid down by this Court in Figgies ' case. (viii) Though a firm was to be regarded as an entity for the purpose of the Income tax Act, that entity was not to be taken to be disturbed by the coming in or going out of partners. Applying the test to the present case it was held that the identity of the entity was never lost and there was never a succession till the year 1948. No question of the dissolution of the old firm in piece goods business ever arose. It continued right through, even other newly started businesses were owned by it. It cannot be said that the old firm had either discontinued or had been succeeded by another person. Hemchand was a mere employee though described as a partner. The entry of Hemehand did not constitute a dissolution of the old firm. Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay City vs Kolhia Hirdagarh, Co. Ltd., Bombay, (1949) 17 ; and Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay City vs Sir Homi Metters Executor, , referred to.

        "reference": "Khandappa Sangappa Magdum died on June 27, 1960 leaving behind, his widow Hirabai, two sons Gurupad and Shivapad and three daughters. On November, 6, 1952 Hirabai filed special civil suit No. 26/53 for partition and separate possession of a 7/24 share in two houses, a land, two shops and mov ables on the basis that these properties belonged to the joint family consisting of her husband, and their two sons. The case of the plaintiff was that if a partition were to take place during Khandappa 's life time between himself and his two sons the plaintiff would have got a 1/4th share each on the death of Khandappa, Her further case was that Khandappa 's 1/4th share could devolve upon his death on six sharers, entitling her to 1/24th share besides. The trial Court found that the suit properties belonged to the joint family and that there was no prior partition. Following the judgment of the Bombay High Court in Shiramabai Bhimgonda vs Kalgonda , limited her share to only 1/24th and refused to add 1/4th and 1/24th together. Dismissing the defendant 's appeal 524/66 and allowing the cross objections of the plaintiff, the Bombay High Court, by its judgment dated March 19, 1975 following 68 Rom. L.R. 74 which overruled , held that the plaintiff wag entitled to 7/24th share. Dismissing the appeal by special leave, the Court. HELD : 1. (a) What Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act. 1956 deals with is the devolution of the interest which a male Hindu has in a Mitakshara property at the time of his death. The proviso to Section 6 contains a formula, for fixing the share of the claimants while Explanation I contains a formula for deducing the share of the deceased. [765 H, 766 A B] (b) Explanation I which contains the formula for determining the share of the deceased creates a fiction by providing that the interest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to be, the share in the property that would have been allotted to him if a partition of the property had taken place immediately before his death. Whether a partition had actually taken place between the plaintiffs husband and his sons is beside the point for the purposes of Explanation 1. That Explanation compels the assumption of a fiction that in fact \"a partition of the property had taken place\", the point of time of the partition being the one immediately before the death of the person in whose property the heirs claim a share. The fiction created by Explanation I has to be given its due and full effect. [766 E F, 767 C D] Commissioner of Income Tax, Delhi vs section Teja Singh, ; applied. East End Dwellings Co. Ltd. vs Finsbury Borough Council, 132, quoted with approval 2. (a) In order to ascertain the share of heirs in the property of a deceased coparcener it is necessary in the very nature of things, and as they Very first step to ascertain the share of the deceased in the coparcenary property , by dong that alone can one determine the extent of the claimant 's share. Explanation 1 to section 6 resorts to the simple expedient, undoubtedly factional, that. 14 315SCI/78 762 the interest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener \"shall be deemed to be the share in the property that would have been allotted to him if a partition of that property had taken place immediately before his death. What is therefore required to be assumed is that a partition had in fact taken place between the deemed and his coparceners immediately before his death. That assumption, once made, is irrevocable. In other words, the assumption having been made once for the purpose of ascertaining the share of the deceased in the coparcenary property, one cannot go back on that assumption and ascertain the share of the heirs without reference, to it. The assumption which the statute requires to be made that a partition had in fact taken place must permeate the entire process of ascertainment of the ultimate share of the heirs, through all its stages. To make the assumption at the initial stage for the limited purpose of ascertaining the share of the deceased and then to ignore it for calculating the quantum of the share of the heirs is truly to permit one 's imagination to boggle. All the consequences which flow from a real partition have to be logically worked out, which means that the share of the heirs must be ascertained on the basis that they had separated from one another and had received a share in the partition which had taken place during the life time of the deceased. The allotment of this share is not a processual step devised merely for the purpose of working out some other conclusion. it has to be treated and accepted as a concrete reality, something that cannot be recalled just as a share allotted to a coparcener in an actual partition cannot generally be recalled. The inevitable corollary of this position is that the heir will get his or her share in the interest which the deceased had in the coparcenary property at the time of his death, in addition to the share which he or she received or must be deemed to have received in the notional partition. [768 B G] (b) Ibis interpretation furthers the legislative intent in regard to the enlargement of the share of female heirs, qualitatively and quantatively. Even assuming that two interpretations of Explanation 1 are reasonably possible, Courts must prefer that interpretation which will further the intention of the legislature and remedy the injustice from which the Hindu women have suffered over the years. By restricting the operation of the fiction created by Explana tion I in the manner suggested by the appellant, Courts, shall be taking a retrograde step, putting back as it were the clock of social reform which has enabled the Hindu women to acquire an equal status with males in matters of pro perty.

Bhatt, A.I.R. 1974 Guj. 23; Ananda vs Haribandu, A.I.R. 1967 Orissa 194; approved. In the instant case, (a) There is no justification for limiting the plaintiff 's share to 1/24th by ignoring the 1/4th share which she would have obtained had there been a partition during her husband 's life time between him and his two sons. In a partition between Khandappa and his two sons, there would be four sharers in the coparcenary property, the fourth being Khandappa 's wife, the plaintiff. Khandappa would have therefore got a 1/4th share in the coparcenary property on the hypothesis of a partition between himself and his sons. [766 G H, 767 B C] (b) By the application of the normal rule prescribed by Section 6 of the , Khandappa 's interest in the coparcenary property would devolve by survivorship upon the surviving members of the coparcenary and not in accordance with the provisions of the Act. But, since the widow and daughter are amongst the female relatives specified in class I of the Schedule to the Act and Khandappa died leaving behind a widow and daughters, ,he proviso to section 6 comes into play and the normal rule is excluded. Khandappa 's interest in the coparcenary property would therefore devolve, according to the proviso, by intestate succession under the Act and not by survivorship. Testamentary succession is out of question as the deceased had not made a testamentary disposition though, under the explanation to section 763 30 of the Act, the interest of a male Hindu in Mitakshara coparcenary. property is capable of being disposed of by a will or other testamentary disposition. [765 E G] (c) The plaintiff 's share as determined by the application of the rules of intestate succession contained in Sections 8, 9 and 10 of the Hindu Succession . Act will be 1/6th. The deceased Khandappa died leaving behind him two sons, three daughters and a widow. The son, daughter. and widow are mentioned as heirs in class I of the Schedule and therefore, by reason of the provisions of section 8(a) read with the 1st clause of section 9, they take simultaneously and to the exclusion of other heirs. As between them the two son 's, the three daughters and the widow will take equally. each having one share in the deceased 's property under section 10 read with Rules 1 and 2 of that section.

This involved taking over the management of many insurance companies.\n* **Transfer of Employees:**  Employees of the former insurance companies were transferred to the LIC. These employees were given a new contract of service under the Life Insurance Corporation of India (Staff) Regulations, 1960.\n* **Retirement Age:** The regulations initially set the retirement age at 55 years for all employees, but the LIC had the power to extend this age for some employees.\n\n**Key Issues:**\n\n* **Disagreement on Retirement Age:** There was disagreement about the appropriate retirement age for transferred employees. Some argued that the age should be 55, while others argued that it should be 60.\n* **Central Government's Role:** The Central Government had the power to make regulations regarding the retirement age of employees of the LIC.\n* **Standardisation Order:** The Central Government issued a \"Standardisation Order\" in 1957 to standardize the retirement age for all employees of the LIC. This order was intended to ensure uniformity in the retirement age across all employees.\n\n**Legal Arguments:**\n\n* **Arguments for 55 Years:** Some argued that the retirement age should be 55 years because it was the standard retirement age for many other insurance companies.\n* **Arguments for 60 Years:** Others argued that the retirement age should be 60 years because it was the standard retirement age for many other insurance companies.\n* **Arguments for Flexibility:** The LIC argued that it should have the flexibility to retire employees earlier if their efficiency was impaired.\n\n**Court's Decision:**\n\n* **The Court's Role:** The court was tasked with resolving the dispute over the retirement age.\n* **The Court's Ruling:** The court ruled that the retirement age for transferred employees should be 58 years. However, the appointing authority could extend this age to 60 years if the employee's efficiency was impaired.\n\n**Regulations:**\n\n* **Regulations for Different Categories:** The LIC issued regulations to clarify the retirement age for different categories of employees.\n* **Regulations for Transferred Employees:** The regulations for transferred employees were based on the Standardisation Order.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe case highlights the complex legal issues that arise when a government nationalizes an industry and then tries to manage it. The court's decision was based on a balance of competing interests, including the need for uniformity, the need for flexibility, and the need to protect the interests of the employees.",
        "reference": "The Life Insurance Corporation was established on Sep tember 1, 1956 under the Life Insurance Act of 1956 (Act 31 of 1956) by amalgamating about 200 insurers carrying on life insurance business in the country. It had no employees of its own to carry on the vast business which had been taken over and the nature of the work was such that the Corpora tion required the services of employees with experience and expertise in running life insurance business. In order to meet the above need, Section 11 of the Act came to be enact ed. Sub section (1) provided that with effect from September 1, 1956, every whole time employee of the erstwhile insurers would become an employee of the Corporation and hold office therein by the same tenure, at the same remuneration, and upon the same terms and conditions and with the same rights and privileges as to pension and gratuity and other matters as he would have held on September 1, 1956, had the Act not been passed. The conditions of service of the employees whose serv ices were transferred to the Corporation under Section 11(1) were not uniform. The conditions governing the retirement of those employees were also diverse and different. In some cases the age of retirement had been fixed at 55 years, in some at 58 years and in some others at 60 years. In many cases, the insurers had permitted their employees to contin ue in 181 their services even beyond 60 years depending upon their efficiency and physical capacity. For the purposes of rationalising the pay scales of the transferred employees, under sub section (2) of Section 11 the Central Government was empowered to alter the terms of service of the employees as to their remuneration in such manner as it thought fit. The sub section was amended by Acts 17 and 36 01 ' 1957. Clause (bb) of sub section (2) 01 ' Section 49 conferred power on the Corporation to make regulations with the previ ous approval of the Central Government as regards 'the terms and conditions of service of persons who had become employ ees of the Corporation under subsection (1) 01 ' Section 11 '. Under clauses (b) and (bb) of Section 49(2) 01 ' the Act, Regulations were framed prescribing the ages of retirement of the employees of the Corporation belonging to different categories with the previous approval of the Central Govern ment and were incorporated in the Life Insurance Corporation of India (Staff) Regulations, 1960 made by the Corporation which came into effect on July, 1960. Under Regulation 19(1), all transferred employees were entitled to remain in service till they completed 60 years of age but the appointing authority was empowered to retire any such transferred employee on completion of 55 years of age or at any time thereafter, if his efficiency was found to have been impaired. Under Regulation 19(2) employees appointed to the service of the Corporation on or after September, 1956, were required to retire on completion of 58 years of age but the appointing authority was empowered to retire any such employee on completion of 55 years of age or thereafter if his efficiency was found to have been im paired. In the case of the transferred employees this regulation was made in conformity with the 'standardisation order ' passed in respect of Class III and Class IV transferred employees. in whose case the age of retirement was fixed at 60 years. The result was that the regulation made a clear and distinct classification 01 ' all the employees of the Corporation belonging to all classes into two groups transferred employees and the employees appointed after September 1, 1956 for purposes of the age of retire ment having regard to the historical reasons. 182 Consequent upon the settlement arrived at, upon an industrial dispute which arose between Class III and Class IV employees who were appointed subsequent to September 1, 1956 in the Corporation. Regulation 19 of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (Staff) Regulations 1960 which came into force w.e.f. July 1, 1960 was amended and the employees of the Corporation were divided both longitudinally and latitudinally insofar as the age of retirement was con cerned. Longitudinally, all the transferred employees be longing to Class I and II became entitled to continue in service till they attained the age of 60 years, the Corpora tion being empowered to retire any of them prematurely on completion of 55 years of age if his efficiency was found to have been impaired, and all the Class I and Class II offi cers appointed to the service of the Corporation on or after September 1, 1956 had to retire on completion of 58 years of age subject again to the power of the Corporation to retire any such employee on completion of 55 years of age or at any time thereafter if his efficiency was found to have been impaired. Latitudinally, the employees were divided into two groups and all the employees belonging to Class III and Class IV, irrespective of the tact whether they were trans ferred employees or employees appointed after September 1, 1956 were entitled to continue in service till 60 years of age, but the employees belonging to Class I and Class II who were appointed to the service of the Corporation on or after September 1, 1956 had to retire on the completion of 58 years of age subject to the usual clause relating to prema ture retirement. Sub regulation (2) of Regulation 19 was modified empow ering the appointing authority to extend at its discretion of service of any employee of the Corporation belonging to Class I or Class II categories appointed to service on or after September 1, 1956 for one year at a time upto 60 years of age. The power to extend the service of employees belong ing to Class I and Class II appointed on or after September 1, 1956 beyond 58 years or ' age was withdrawn from January 21, 1977 and the Corporation was permitted to retire an employee on completion of 50 years of age. The first respondent joined the Corporation as a Class III employee on March 22, 1957. Subsequently, he was promot ed to a Class I post and ultimately as Assistant Divisional Manager. Since he was born in the month of June, 1926, notice was issued to him in February, 1984 of his retirement which was due on June 30, 1984 on his completing the age of 58 years. Before the date of his retirement, he instituted a writ petition in the High Court questioning the validity of Regulation 19(2) of the (Staff) Regulations, 1960, as it stood then and prayed for the issue 183 of writ of mandamus directing the Corporation not to retire him before he attained the age of 60 years. It was contended by the first respondent before the High Court that there was no justification to prescribe two different ages of retirement one for the transferred employ ees belonging to Class I and Class II categories and the other for the employees who joined the service of the Corpo ration alter September 1, 1956 and who also belonged to Class I and Class II categories, and that in regard to those who joined the service after being appointed to Class III post after September 1, 1956, there could not be any reduc tion of age of retirement from 60 to 58 years on their being promoted to a Class I or Class II post. Since he had the right to continue in service if he had remained in Class III only till he attained the age of 60 years as a Class III employee, age of retirement could not be reduced to 58 years only because he had been promoted to a Class I post. It was urged on behalf of the Corporation and the Union of India that the transferred employees and the employees who joined the service after September 1, 1956 belonged to two distinct and separate classes which had been treated differently throughout for valid reasons. Since there was no uniformity in the establishments in which the transferred employees were working prior to nationalisation of the life insurance business, it became necessary to fix the age of retirement of the transferred employees on a lair, equitable and just basis. In the circumstances, the classification of the employees into two categories, namely, transferred employees and others who joined on or after September 1, 1956 for the purposes of age of superannuation was a valid classification and Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution had not been violated. It was further submitted that the discrimination made between the employees belonging to Class I and Class II on the one hand and the employees belonging to Class III and Class IV on the other in the matter of the age of superannuation was not invalid since they belonged to two different categories of employees who were governed by different conditions of service as regards pay, perquisites, allowances, administrative powers etc. The High Court did not find any unconstitutionality in a rule or regulation providing the age of retirement at 60 years of employees who had been absorbed from the service of the erstwhile insurers and to that extent it held that the grouping being reasonable the Court might not travel into the domain of legislative policy. It, however, found that when once a transferred employee belonging to Class III and an emp 184 loyee appointed after 1st September, 1956 by the Corporation to a Class III post is promoted to Class I, the distinction of the transferred employee and direct appointee could not be maintained, as on promotion they became persons belonging to the same category of employees enjoying the same condi tions of service. Hence the age of retirement should be the same in the case of both such promotees. It accordingly held that the first respondent was entitled to continue till he attained the age of 60 years as other Class I employees belonging to the category of transferred employees. The Writ Petition was allowed and Regulation 19(2) was struck down as being violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India and the Corporation was directed not to retire the first respondent before he attained the age of 60 years. Allowing the appeals, by special leave, of the Life Insurance Corporation of India and the Union of India, this Court, HELD: 1.1 The decision taken by the Corporation and the Central Government as regards the ages of retirement of the different classes of the employees of the Corporation is a bona fide one and cannot be characterised as unreasonable and it is not, therefore, liable to be upset by a decision of the Court. [222G] 1.2 In the instant case, the High Court erred in strik ing down Regulation 19(2) of the L.I.C. (Staff) Regulations 1960 as amended in the year 1977 and in directing the Corpo ration to continue the first respondent in its service till he completed the age of 60 years. [223A] 2.1 Classification of employees into two categories for purposes of fixing the age of superannuation depending upon the date of entry into service is not something which is unusual, and such classification becomes necessary on ac count of historical facts and the need for treating the employees in a fair and just way. [220G] 2.2 Merely because the pay, allowances and other perqui sites drawn by the transferred employees and by the employ ees appointed after September 1, 1956 by the Corporation are the same, it cannot be said that the transferred employees and the other employees had been integrated so as to form one cadre. So far as the age of retirement is concerned, they are being treated differently right from the date on which the Corporation was established. [221G] 2.3 In the instant case, since the classification of the employees for the purpose of age of retirement into two categories is reasonable 185 and not arbitrary and there is a reasonable nexus between the classification and the object to be attained thereby, it is not possible to ho1d that Regulation 19(2) is violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. [222C] 3. The Act itself made a distinction between the trans ferred employees and the employees recruited to the service of the Corporation after September 1, 1956 by making amend ments in Section 11 and in clauses (b) and (bb) of sub section (2) of Section 49 of the Act. In the (Staff) Regula tions, 1956 and the (Staff) Regulations, 1960 there was again a distinction made between the transferred employees and the employees recruited alter September 1, 1956. The distinction between the two classes Is recognised by Parlia ment even as late as 1981 which it amended Section 49 of the Act by deleting clause (bb) of sub section (2) thereof and by amending Section 48. of the Act by introducing clause (cc) in sub section (2) and the new sub section (2A) in it. At no point of time the transferred employees were integrat ed into one cadre alongwith employees appointed after Sep tember 1, 1956 as such and the transferred employees have retained their birth marks throughout. The tact that the pay, allowances and other conditions or services have been made the same in respect of both the transferred employees and the employees of the Corporation recruited after Septem ber 1, 1956 has not brought about the integration of the two Classes of employees into one single cadre. [214GH; 215A: E F] 4.1 The determination of 58 years as age of superannua tion, in the case of the employees, who entered service after September 1, 1956 by itself cannot be considered to be arbitrary since in almost all the public sector corpora tions, Central services and the State services, 58 years age is considered to be a reasonable age at which officers can be directed to retire from their service. [212C] 4.2 Regarding the dIscrimination in the age or ' retire ment between employees belonging to Class I and Class II on the one hand and Class III and Class IV on the other, it is true that originally employees belonging to Class III and Class IV categories amongst the transferred employees were given the benefit of retirement at the age of 60 years, but the employees belonging to Class III and Class IV categories after 1st September, 1956 were required to retire on the completion of 58 years of age. Pursuant to the settlement arrived at between the Management and the Class III and IV employees recruited after September 1, 1956. this discrimi nation was removed and Regulation 19 was amended w.e.f. June 19, 1965. [212D F] 186 4.3 Having regard to the lower emoluments and other benefits which the employees belonging to Class III and Class IV are entitled to get from the Corporation and the higher emoluments and other benefits to which officers belonging to Class I and Class II are entitled to and also the nature of their work and the powers enjoyed by them, fixation of different ages of retirement to the different classes of employees could not by itself be violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. [212F G] 5. Having regard to different conditions of service that were prevailing in the various establishments whose business was taken over by the Corporation, fixation of age of super annuation is one of the essential parts or ' the process of transfer and integration to which sub section (2) of Section 11 of the Act is applicable. The fixation of 60 years as the age of superannuation in the case of transferred employees cannot be considered to be unreasonable in view of the history of this case. [208C D] 6. The transferred employees who are treated favourably belong to a vanishing group and, perhaps, within a period of two years none of them would be in the service of the Corpo ration. Thereafter, only one class of employees would be in the service of the Corporation, namely, those appointed subsequent to September 1, 1956 by the Corporation in re spect of whom the Corporation has fixed the age of retire ment as 58 years which corresponds to the age or ' retirement in almost all the public sector establishments, the Central Government services and the State Government services. [221C E] 7. The High Court was right in holding that it was not discriminatory to extend the benefit of the age of 60 years to the transferred employees. However, it was not correct in holding that on promotion from Class III to Class I, the transferred employees and the directly recruited employees would lose their birth marks. The intention of Parliament was that even as late as in 1981 the two groups of employ ees, namely, the transferred employees and employees re cruited after September 1, 1956 in the Corporation should be kept separate. In these circumstances, the High Court was in the error in holding that when employees are recruited to a lower grade from two sources, no favourable treatment should be extended to recruits from one source on their promotion to the higher grade. The fact that an employee had entered the service of the Corporation after September 1, 1956 in a Class III post and is later on promoted to a Class I post does not make any difference. [216E H; 217D] 187 8. In the instant case, when the first respondent was promoted to the Class I post in 1963 the age of retirement of officers in the Class I post had been fixed at 58 years and was not different from the age of retirement of Class III employees. It was only in 1965 under the settlement, the age of retirement of employees in Class III and Class IV who joined service after September 1, 1956 was raised to 60 years. If he felt that the conditions of service ill ' Class I officers were likely to be prejudicial to him, he could have refused the promotion offered to him. Having accepted the promotion alongwith the higher benefits flowing from it he cannot contend after several years that he had been prejudicially affected by the condition relating to the age of retirement applicable to Class I officers appointed after September 1, 1956. That apart, the higher emoluments and other perquisites to which Class I employees may be entitled to and the better conditions of work which are enjoyed by them substantially compensate the effect of the lowering of the age of retirement from 60 years to 58 years.

Tewatia of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. They alleged that the judge had engaged in political discussions, criticized the government, and expressed his support for a communist system.\n* **The High Court's Action:** The High Court issued a notice to the appellants, finding prima facie evidence of contempt of court.

Ltd. (petitioner) challenged the constitutionality of certain sections of the Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947.\n* The Act, enacted before India became a republic, aimed to investigate and prosecute individuals who evaded income tax during a period of wartime black marketing.\n* The petitioner argued that the Act's provisions, particularly sections 5(1), 5(4), 6, 7, and 8, were discriminatory and violated the principles of equal protection of the laws.\n\n**The Act's Provisions:**\n\n* **Section 5(1):** Allowed the Central Government to refer cases of substantial tax evasion to the Investigation Commission.\n* **Section 5(4):**  Gave the Commission the power to refer cases of tax evasion to the Commission if they had \"reason to believe\" that someone other than the person under investigation had evaded taxes.\n* **Section 6:**  Provided the Commission with extensive powers to investigate and gather evidence.\n* **Section 7:**  Regulated the procedure for the Commission's investigations.\n* **Section 8:**  Allowed the Commission to initiate proceedings against individuals who evaded taxes, even if they were not referred by the Central Government under section 5(1).\n\n**The Court's Decision:**\n\n* The court found that the Act's provisions, particularly section 5(4), did not violate the guarantee of equal protection of the laws.\n* The court reasoned that section 5(4) did not create a separate class of individuals from those covered by section 5(1), but rather applied to all individuals who evaded taxes.\n* The court emphasized that the Act's provisions were not arbitrary and did not discriminate against individuals based on their income or the amount of tax they evaded.\n\n**Key Arguments:**\n\n* **Petitioner's Argument:**\n    * Section 5(1) was vague and lacked a clear definition of \"substantial\" tax evasion.\n    * Section 5(4) gave the Commission the power to add to the number of people investigated, potentially leading to arbitrary decisions.\n* **Respondent's Argument:**\n    * The Act was based on a valid classification of individuals who evaded taxes during wartime.\n    * The Act was necessary to address wartime black marketing and tax evasion.\n    * The Act did not discriminate against individuals based on their income or the amount of tax they evaded.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe court upheld the constitutionality of the Act, finding that it did not violate the principles of equal protection of the laws. The court also rejected the petitioner's arguments regarding the vagueness of the \"substantial\" term and the potential for arbitrary decision-making. \n\n\n**Important Note:** This summary provides a general overview of the case and its legal implications. For a complete understanding, it is recommended to read the full judgment.",
        "reference": "Sub section (4) of section 5 of the Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947, does not deal with the same class of persons as are said to have been grouped together in subsection (1) of section 5 of the Act as persons who to a substantial extent evaded payment of taxation on income. On a plain reading of the section it is clear that sub section (4) of section 5 is not limited only to persons who made extraordinary profits and to all persons who may have evaded payment of taxation on income irrespective of whether the evaded profits are substantial or insubstantial and therefore the scope of sub section (4) of section 5 is different from the scope of sub section (1) of section 5 both in extent and range. Sub section (4) of section 5 of the Act, obviously deals with the same class of persons who fall within the ambit of section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act and are dealt with in sub section (1) of that section and whose income can be caught by the proceeding under that section. It is not possible to hold that all such persons who evaded payment of income tax and do not truly disclose all particulars or material facts necessary for their assessment and against whom a, report is made under sub section (4) of section 5 of the impugned 449 Act by themselves form a class distinct from those who evade payment of income tax and come within the ambit of section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act. Both section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1.922, and subsection (4) of section 5 of the Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947, deal with all persons who have similar characteristics and similar properties, the common characteristics being that they are persons who have not truly disclosed their income and have evaded payment of taxation on income. The procedure prescribed by the Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947, is substantially more prejudicial and more drastic to the assessee than the procedure under the Indian Income tax Act (XI of 1922). Held, therefore that sub section (4) of section 5 and the procedure prescribed by the impugned Act in so far as it affects the persons proceeded against under that sub section being a piece of discriminatory legislation offends against the provisions of article 14 of the Constitution and is thus void and unenforceable."

Proceedings for prosecution of its Secretary were instituted, where upon the respondent filed a petition in the High Court for quashing the order of the appellant and for directing the Magistrate not to proceed with the complaint. Before the High Court the appellant contended that the respondent was a 'commercial establishment ' because, the activity of the respondent amounted to a 'Profession ', and alternatively, that the case fell within the latter part of the definition of 'commercial establishment ' in section 2(5), inasmuch as its activities were connected with trade and business generally, but, it was not urged that the activity of the respondent amounted to carrying on any 'business or trade ' in its premises. The writ petition was allowed by the High Court, holding that premises of the respondent were not a 'commercial establishment '. In appeal to this Court it was contended that the activities of the respondent amounted to a 'trade or business ', that therefore it was a 'commercial establishment ' and that the matter was covered by Management of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry vs Sri R. K. Mittal [1972] 2 S.C.R. 353. Allowing the appeal. HELD : (1) It is not proper to shut out the contentions of the appellant now raised about the activity of the respondent being a 'trade or business ' merely on the ground that the point was not properly put before the High Court. The question is only one of drawing a correct inference about the point in issue from the material already on record and will not require any additional material for decision. [354E F] (2)A place, in order to fall within the definition of 'commercial establishment ' must, in the first instance, be 'premises '. and secondly, should be premises wherein, (a) any trade, business or profession is carried on, or (b) any work in connection with or incidental or ancillary thereto is carried on. [353C D] (3) The registered office of the respondent is 'premises '. [353D] (4) All the activities of the respondent are business activities and are carried on systematically. Though the profit made by it is ploughed back for its purposes as set out in its Memorandum of Association and is not distributed among its members.

The appellant (the pensioner) argues that the pension is not agricultural income, while the respondent (the tax authority) argues that it is.\n\n**Legal Arguments:**\n\n* **Appellant's Argument:**\n    * The pension is not derived from land, but from a contractual obligation of the Government to pay a pension in lieu of the landowner's rights.\n    * The source of the pension is the 1837 settlement, not the land itself.\n    * The Privy Council and Indian Court decisions have established that income derived from a contractual obligation is not agricultural income.\n* **Respondent's Argument:**\n    * The pension is derived from land revenue, as the land revenue was the basis for the pension calculation.\n    * The pension is a form of compensation for relinquishing land rights, which is a capital receipt.\n    * The word \"pension\" in the 1837 letter is not the key to determining the nature of the income.\n\n**Court's Decision:**\n\n* The Court agrees with the appellant's interpretation of the 1837 settlement and the Privy Council and Indian Court decisions.\n* The Court finds that the pension is not agricultural income because it is not derived from land but from a contractual obligation.\n* The Court rejects the respondent's argument that the pension is a capital receipt.\n* The Court concludes that the pension is revenue income and not exempt from taxation.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* The appeal is allowed, and the tax authority is ordered to pay the costs of the appeal.\n\n\n**Key Legal Principles:**\n\n* **Substance over Form:** The Court emphasizes that the true nature of the transaction, not the label given to it, determines its taxability.\n* **Contractual Obligations:** The Court recognizes that contractual obligations can give rise to income that is not agricultural income.\n* **Interpretation of Legislation:** The Court relies on the interpretation of the Income Tax Act and previous legal precedents to determine the taxability of the pension. \n\n\n**Overall:** This case highlights the importance of understanding the true nature of income and the legal principles that govern its classification for tax purposes.",
        "reference": "The respondent was the head of a Hindu undivided family and was the descendant of a Jagirdar. Certain disputes between the Jagirdar and the Zamindars in the district had been settled in 1837 by a compromise between the British Government and the then Jagirdar, whereby, the Government granted the Jagirdar and his heirs a pension in perpetuity to be calculated on the basis of one fourth of the revenue of the Jagir. By this arrangement the collections from the Jagir became payable by the Zamindars direct to the Government and the Jagirdar and his successors no longer remained the proprietors of the Jagir and became entitled only to a pension. The Income tax Officer assessed the receipt of the pension by the respondent as part of his regular income and rejected the latter 's contention that the amount received was agricultural income within the meaning of section 4(3)(viii) of the Income tax Act, 1922. In appeal, the Assistant Commissioner accepted the respondent 's contention, but the Tribunal reversed this finding. The High Court, on a reference, decided the issue in favour of the respondent, on the grounds, inter alia, that the right conferred under the compromise of 1837 was a right to a share of one fourth in the net land revenue collections and furthermore, the amount received by the successors of the Jagirdar varied from year to year. In the appeal before the Supreme Court, it was also contended on behalf of the respondent that the amount received was in the nature of a capital receipt, being a payment to the Jagirdar and his successors of compensation for relinquishing the title to the Jagir lands. HELD: (i) Under the compromise and arrangement of 1837, the respondent had no interest in the land or in the land revenue payable in respect thereof. [704 A] State of U.P.v. Kunwar Sri Trivikram Narain Singh; , , followed. As the source of the income in this case was the arrangement of 1837, the income could not be held to be derived from land within the meaning of the definition of agricultural income in section 2(1)(a) of the Act. Even if the income varied from year to year, the source of the income was still the arrangement and not land. [705 G] Maharajkumar Gopal Saran Narain Singh, vs C.I.T. Bihar and Orissa, , C.I.T.

(ii) The amount received by the respondent was not a capital receipt but revenue income and therefore taxable. 701 Where an owner of an estate exchanges a capital asset for a perpetual annuity, it is ordinarily taxable in his hands. The position would be different if he exchanged his estate for a capital sum payable in installments. Such installments when received would not be taxable as income.

These rules specify that promotions are to be made based on a selection list prepared by a Departmental Promotion Committee.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n* **Petitioners' Argument:** The petitioners argue that the respondents have violated their rights by not promoting them based on the rules, even though they have completed the required service. They point to the circular dated 6th November, 1962, which they claim accelerated their chances of promotion.\n* **Respondents' Argument:** The respondents argue that the circular dated 6th November, 1962, was an executive instruction and did not override the rules. They claim that the rules, specifically Rule 8, dictate the promotion process, and the circular merely accelerated the chance of promotion. They also argue that the petitioners' chances of promotion were not affected by the circular.\n* **Constitutional Considerations:** The petitioners also argue that the respondents' actions violate Article 16 of the Constitution, which guarantees equality of opportunity. However, the respondents argue that the right to promotion is not a condition of service, and the circular did not change the conditions of service.\n\n**Key Legal Precedents:**\n\n* **B. N. Nagarajan & Ors. vs State of Mysore & Ors.:** This case established that executive instructions could not override rules made under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution.\n* **Sant Ram Sharma vs State of Rajasthan & Anr.:** This case further clarified that executive instructions could not override rules made under the proviso to Article 309.\n* **Ramchandra Shankar Deodhar & Ors. vs The State of Maharashtra & Ors.:** This case dealt with the impact of a change in the rules of promotion on the conditions of service of employees.\n* **Mohammad Shujat Ali & Ors. vs Union of India & Ors.:** This case highlighted that the subsequent circulars and orders did not affect the conditions of service of employees who joined later than the date of the circular.\n\n**The Court's Decision:**\n\nThe Court ultimately decided that the respondents' actions did not violate the petitioners' rights under Article 16. The Court found that the circular did not change the conditions of service and that the rules governing promotion were clear and unambiguous. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Court's decision emphasizes the importance of following the rules and procedures established by the government. It also highlights the need for a clear distinction between executive instructions and the rules that govern the conditions of service.",

Their grievance was th at even though quite a large number of Supervisors Grade ' A ' had been promoted to the post of Chargeman Grade II on completion of two years ' satisfactory work, in pursuance of the circular dated 6th November, 1962, they had been di s criminated against and had not been so promoted immediate ly on the expiry of two years ' service. The writ petition was contested on the ground that t he promotion from Supervisor Grade 'A ' to Chargeman II we re governed by the Indian Ordnance Factories (Recruitment a nd Conditions of Service of Grade III Personnel) Rules, 19 56 and such promotions could be made only in accordance wi th the procedure prescribed by Rule 8 of these Rules. The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition on the ground of unexplained laches. The Division Bench did n ot find any substance in the submission made on behalf of t he petitioners and dis 93 missed their special appeal. According to the Divisi on Bench, it was difficult to read in the circular that aft er two years of satisfactory service there would be automat ic promotion from Supervisor Grade 'A ' to Chargeman II as su ch a view would militate against Rule 12 of the Rules, whi ch provided that no appointment shall be made otherwise than as specified in the Rules. It was further held by the Divisi on Bench that even assuming that some Supervisors Grade 'A ' h ad been automatically promoted on completion of two year s ' service, without the recommendation after screening by t he Promotion Committee, as provided in Rule 8, no right wou ld accrue in favour of the appellants inasmuch as such prom o tions would be in the teeth of Rule 12. Against the judgment of the Division Bench, Civil Appe al No. 441 of 1981 (Virendra Kumar and Others vs Union of Ind ia and Others, was preferred and this Court by its order dated 2.2.1981 directed that the cases of the 75 appellants in Civil Appeal No. 441 of 1981 be considered f or promotion as Chargeman Grade II and they be so promot ed unless found to be unfit.

Special Leave Petitions against t he judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court were dismissed by this Court. The petitioners in the present writ petitions pray th at the same relief may be granted to them as had been grant ed in Civil Appeal No. 441 of 1981. In the Civil Miscellaneous petitions now filed in Civ il Appeal No. 441 of 1981, the petitioners, apart from t he prayer for initiating proceedings for contempt against t he respondents for disobedience of the order of this Cou rt dated 2.2.1981, have prayed for orders directing the r e spondents to implement in true letter and spirit the sa id order and to promote the petitioners to the next high er posts after giving them the benefit of the directions of that order.

(2) Notwithstanding the issue of instructions dated 6 th November, 1962 the procedure for making promotion as la id down in Rule 8 of the Rules had to be followed, and the sa id procedure could not be abrogated by the executive instru c tions dated 6th November 1962. [103F] (3) The only effect of the circular dated 6th Novemb er 1962 was that Supervisors 'A ' on completion of 2 year s ' satisfactory service could be promoted by following t he procedure contemplated by Rule 8. This circular had inde ed the effect of accelerating the chance of promotion. T he right to promotion on the other hand was to be governed by the Rules. This right of promotion as provided by the Rul es was neither affected nor could be affected by the circula r.

[106H; 107A B] (5) Circular dated 20th January, 1966 could not be treated to be one affecting adversely any condition of service of Supervisors 'A '. Its only effect was that t he chance of promotion which had been accelerated by the circ u lar dated 6th November, 1962 was deferred and made depende nt on selection according to the Rules. Though a right to be considered for promotion was a condition of service, me re chances of promotion were not.

The fact that some Supervisors 'A ' had been promot ed before the coming into force of the order dated 20th Jan u ary, 1966 could not, therefore, constitute the basis for an argument that those Supervisors 'A ' whose cases came up f or consideration thereafter and who were promoted in due cour se in accordance with the Rules, were discriminated agains t.

The Court had to determine whether this clause, which grants preference to certain applicants, violates the principles of equality guaranteed by Article 14 of the Indian Constitution.\n* **Validity of Clause (iv):** The Court also examined the constitutionality of clause (iv) of the proviso, which grants preference to \"operators of tourist cars, or such travel agents, as may be approved in this behalf by the Ministry dealing in tourism.\" This clause was challenged on the grounds that it gives undue discretion to the Central Government and undermines the decision-making process of the designated tribunal.\n\n**Supreme Court's Decision:**\n\n* The Supreme Court held that the \"preference\" clause in the proviso to section 63(7) is unconstitutional. \n* The Court found that the clause:\n    * **Preempts the decision of the designated tribunal:** It gives the Central Government excessive power to grant approval without proper guidelines or criteria.\n    * **Is arbitrary and unreasonable:** It grants preference based on the approval of the Central Government, which is not a transparent or objective process.\n    * **Is vague and lacks clarity:** The Court found that the scheme for granting approval to tourist transport operators is unclear and lacks specific guidelines for the exercise of discretion.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* The Supreme Court set aside the orders of the State Transport Appellate Tribunal and the High Court.\n* The Court directed the State Transport Appellate Tribunal to re-hear the appeals in accordance with the principles of equality and the Constitution.\n\n**Implications:**\n\n* This judgment clarifies the limitations of the \"preference\" clause in the proviso to section 63(7) and emphasizes the importance of a transparent and objective process for granting permits.\n* It reaffirms the principle of equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Indian Constitution and ensures that the decision-making process for granting permits is fair and impartial.\n\n\n**In summary, the Supreme Court ruled that the \"preference\" clause in the proviso to section 63(7) is unconstitutional because it gives undue power to the Central Government and undermines the decision-making process of the designated tribunal.**",
        "reference": "Sub section (7) of section 63 of the empowers the State Transport Authority, for the purpose of promoting tourism, to grant permits valid for the whole or any part of India, in respect of such number of tourist vehicles as the Central Government may in respect of that State specify in this behalf. A proviso to that sub section, introduced by section 24 of the Amending Act of 1978 laid down that preference shall be given to applications for permits from (i) the India Tourism Development Corporation; (iii) a State Tourism Development Corporation; (iii) a State Tourist Department, and (iv) operators of tourist cars, or travel agents, approved in this behalf by the Central Government. There were as many as 495 applications before the Karnataka State Transport Authority for the grant of 14 All India Tourist Vehicle permits. By its proceedings dated April 30, 1984, the Authority granted 11 permits to the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation, one to the Indian Tourism Development Corporation and two to the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation. 1009 On appeals being preferred, the Karnataka State Transport Appellate Tribunal, by its order dated February 28, 1985 set aside the grant of two permits in favour of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation, three out of eleven permits to the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation, and instead granted three permits to private operators and increased the number of permits granted to the Indian Tourism Development Corporation from one to three, on the premises that in view of the rule of preference enunciated by the proviso to section 63(7) the applications from the non preferred category had to be excluded as the number of applications from the applicants who were required to be given preference exceeded the number of permits to be granted. Though some of the appellants before the Tribunal had better expertise, experience and resources they did not succeed. The High Court rejected the writ petitions on the ground that the rule of preference contained in the proviso to section 63(7) contemplated exclusion of the 'non preferred ' class, if sufficient number of applicants from the preferred classes were available. In these appeals by special leave, it was contended for the appellants that on a correct interpretation of the proviso to section 63(7) the preference became operative only if other things were equal. It was also urged that the fourth sub clause of the proviso offended article 14 of the Constitution, and had to be struck down. Allowing the appeals, the Court, ^ HELD: 1.1 The rule contained in the proviso to section 63(7) of the is a rule of preference and not a rule of exclusion, for it does not say that the permit shall be granted to the categories of operators specified therein. The claims of eligible applicants must be considered on merits, applying the rule of preference whenever the claims are approximately equal. The application of an applicant is not to be altogether excluded from consideration on the sole ground that another applicant is entitled to preference. Though the proviso does not expressly refer to other things being equal, the principle is very much implicit in it. [1015B E] 1.2 What has been said by this Court in Sher Singh vs Union of India; , , about preference in relation to section 47(1 H) applies mutatis mutandis to the preference contemplated by the proviso to section 63(7) in the instant case. [1017C] 1010 2.1 Clause (iv) of the proviso to section 63(7) is arbitrary, unreasonable and unconstitutional. There is no indication in it as to the manner in which the approval of the Central Government is to be sought and granted and the considerations which are expected to weigh with the Central Government. It compels a tribunal, created by a statute for the purpose of considering rival claims and granting permits on merits, to give preference to persons securing the approval of the Executive Government. To the extent the clause goes, it pre empts the decision of the designated tribunal by executive discretion. [1017E G] 2.2 The clause provides for a preference not to operators of tourist vehicles but to operators of tourist cars and travel agents, though the permits to be granted are for tourist vehicles. It is difficult to understand why preference should be given to operators of tourist cars in the matter of granting permits for tourist vehicles which may well be omnibuses required to travel long distances. [1018B C] 2.3 The experience of running a tourist taxi cannot be said to be a better qualification than running a tourist bus when the question is of granting permits for tourist vehicles. [1018C D] 3. Having regard to the definitions of 'tourist vehicle ' and 'motor car ' contained in section 2(29 A) and section 2(16) respectively of the Act, the expression 'tourist cars ' cannot be said to mean 'tourist vehicles '. While a tourist vehicle may include a motor car, a motor car, by definition, excludes an omnibus. [1018D E] In the instant case, the State Transport Appellate Tribunal and the High Court have failed to consider the merits of the claims of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation and the private operators who did not get a certificate of approval from the Central Government, because of the rule of preference contained in proviso to section 63(7). Their orders are, therefore, set aside. The State Transport Appellate Tribunal is directed to re hear the appeals and dispose them of in accordance with law. [1017C E]"

In the appeal to the Supreme Court it was contended, Inter alia, on behalf of the department (i) that Rule 21 A was valid having been made in exercise of the rule making power granted to the State Government under sections 19(1) and 19(2) (c) of the Act whereby it could make rules for the assessment to tax under the Act of businesses which were discontinued or the ownership of which had changed; (ii) that further more under section 10, the whole of the amount outstanding on the date of the default was charged on the property of the person liable to pay the tax; therefore, in the present case, the business which was transferred to the respondent was charged with the payment of sales tax and it was open to the sales tax authorities to proceed against the assets of the business for realising the amount of sales tax due; and (iii) that upon a true construction of the registered instrument dated October 5, 1956, the respondent undertook to pay all liabilities like sales tax imposed in regard to the business. HELD: dismissing the appeal: (i) Rule 21 A was beyond the rule making power of the State Government either under section 19(1) or section 19(2)(c) and was therefore ultra vires the Act. [666 E F] Although by the amending Act 1 of 1959, an express provision was inserted by which the transferee of the business was made liable for the arrears of sales tax due from the transferor, there was no Such provision in the Act during the period covered by the present case. [664 D] it is manifest that the person who purchases a business as a 'dealer ' can be assessed to sales tax onlY in respect of his turnover and under the scheme of the charging provision of the Act, the purchaser of the busi 662 ness has nothing to do with the sales effected by the seller of the business, The turnover in respect of such sales remains. therefore, the turnover of the transferor and not of the transferee. [664 C] Although section 19(2)(c) deals with the assessment to tax of businesses which are discontinued or the ownership of which has changed, in the context and background of other sections of the Act, the word \"assessment\" used in para 19(2)(c) does not include the. power of recovering tax assessed from a person other than the assessee.

(ii) section 10 of the Act as amended and sought to be relied upon had not come into force until October 8, 1956; in the present case the registered instrument by which the business was transferred to the respondent was dated October 5, 1956 and the amended section therefore had no Application. [666 F] (iii) It was not open to the State Government to rely on the instrument inter vivos between the transferor and the transferee and to contend that there was any contractual obligation between the transferee and the State Government who was not a party to the instrument.

He claimed his dismissal was illegal and sought arrears of pay.\n* **The Defendant:** The State of Gujarat, which was responsible for Joshi's employment.\n* **The Issue:** The central issue was whether Joshi was entitled to arrears of pay, and if so, who should be responsible for paying them.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Article 311(2) of the Constitution:** The plaintiff argued that his dismissal was illegal because the State of Gujarat failed to provide him with a copy of the report of the inquiry conducted against him. He claimed this violated his right to a fair hearing under Article 311(2) of the Constitution.\n2. **Bombay Reorganisation Act, 1960:** The Act outlines how assets and liabilities are to be apportioned between the States of Maharashtra and Gujarat after the reorganization of the Bombay state. This Act is crucial in determining the liability for Joshi's arrears of pay.\n3. **Contractual Relationship:** The court examined whether the relationship between Joshi and the State of Gujarat constituted a contract. The court found that the payment of salary, once fixed, falls under a contractual obligation.\n4. **Liability:** The court ultimately ruled in favor of the State of Gujarat, finding that the arrears of pay were a liability arising from a contract. This was based on the Bombay Reorganisation Act, 1960, which defines the relationship between the State and its employees.\n\n**Key Arguments:**\n\n* **Plaintiff's Argument:** The plaintiff argued that the State of Gujarat violated his right to a fair hearing by not providing him with a copy of the inquiry report. He claimed this was a breach of Article 311(2) of the Constitution.\n* **State of Gujarat's Argument:** The State of Gujarat argued that the plaintiff's claim was based on a \"wrongful dismissal\" and not a breach of contract. They argued that Joshi's employment was not a contract but a position granted by the State.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* The appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court of India.\n* The State of Gujarat was found liable for Joshi's arrears of pay.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Supreme Court of India upheld the High Court's decision, finding that the State of Gujarat was responsible for Joshi's arrears of pay. The court emphasized that the relationship between the State and its employees, particularly in the context of salary payments, falls under a contractual obligation.",
        "reference": "The first respondent while he was holding the post of a Senior Jailor in March, 1954, was suspended on the allegations that he had committed certain acts of misappropriation and maltreatment of prisoners. After January, 1955. A show cause notice was then issued to him to which he replied by a written statement. The respondent was dismissed by an order of Inspector General of Prisons in February, 1955. The respondent filed a suit for a declaration that enquiry report was never supplied to him and consequently he had not been given reasonable opportunity within the meaning of article 311 of the Constitution. He also prayed for a decree for arrears of pay from April, 1954 to May, 1960. His suit was dismissed by the trial court but he succeeded in the first appeal where the order of dismissal was declared illegal and void. An appeal by the respondent to the High Court claiming arrears of salary was allowed. As the State of Bombay had, in the meantime, been reorganised, the High Court also directed that the liability for arrears of salary upto the date of suit would be that of the State of Maharashtra and the liability arising out of the declaration that the appellant was in Government service would be the liability of the State of Gujarat. A Letters Patent appeal filed by the State of Maharashtra was dismissed. In appeal to this Court, it was contended, inter alia, on behalf of the appellant that the liability to pay arrears of pay was not a liability arising out of a contract within the meaning of section 60 of the Bombay Reorganisation Act of 1960 but it was a liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than a breach of contract within the meaning of section 61 of the Act. HELD: (1) The High Court had rightly found that the failure on the part of the competent authority to provide the respondent with a copy of the report of the Enquiry Officer amounted to denial of reasonable opportunity contemplated by article 311(2) of the Constitution. The Inspector General of Prisons had the report before him and the tentative conclusions arrived at by the Enquiry Officer were bound to influence him and in depriving the plaintiff of a copy of the report he was handicapped in not knowing what material was influencing the Inspector General of Prisons. [920 F] Union of India vs H. C. Goel, ; , 728, referred to. It is true that the question whether reasonable opportunity has or has not been ' afforded to the Government servant must depend on the facts 918 of each case, but it would be in very rare cases indeed in which it could be said that the Government servant is not prejudiced by the non supply of the report of the Enquiry officer. [921 B] (2) The decree of the High Court decreeing payment of arrears of salary is truly a liability in proceedings relating to a contract within section 60(2) (a) of the Act. Although the words 'actionable wrong ' other than breach of contract in this context are wide words and include something more than torts, but even so where a suit is brought by a Government servant for arrears of salary the decree more properly falls under section 60 of the Act rather than under a. 61.

The plaintiffs argue that the boundary is conterminous with the northern boundary of the defendants' land, while the defendants claim it's different.\n2. **Limitation of Action:** The plaintiffs claim that the defendants' encroachment occurred in or around 1932, and they only became aware of it in 1941. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs' knowledge of the encroachment was within the three-year limitation period under the Indian Limitation Act.\n3. **Encroachment and Loss of Coal:** The plaintiffs claim that the defendants' encroachment rendered their coal land unusable, resulting in a loss of valuable resources.\n\n**Legal Analysis:**\n\n* **Burden of Proof:** The court emphasizes that the burden of proof lies with the party asserting the affirmative of an issue. In this case, the plaintiffs must prove they had knowledge of the encroachment within three years of filing the suit.\n* **Interpretation of Limitation Act:** The court analyzes the Indian Limitation Act, specifically Article 48, which governs the period of limitation for suits based on conversion or wrongful taking of property.\n* **Evidence and Findings:** The court examines the evidence presented by both parties, including witness testimonies and correspondence between the parties and the Mining Department. The court finds that the evidence does not support the plaintiffs' claim of knowledge of the encroachment before 1941.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n* The court accepts the findings of the lower courts, concluding that the defendants did not encroach upon the plaintiffs' land until 1941, within the three-year limitation period.\n* The court also rejects the plaintiffs' claim that the defendants' encroachment rendered their coal land unusable, as the evidence does not support this claim.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe court dismisses the plaintiffs' appeal and upholds the findings of the lower courts. The defendants are found not to have encroached upon the plaintiffs' land, and the plaintiffs' claim for damages is dismissed. \n\n\n**Important Legal Concepts:**\n\n* **Burden of Proof:** The legal obligation to present evidence to support a claim.\n* **Limitation of Action:** The time limit within which a legal action must be brought.\n* **Indian Limitation Act:** The law governing the time limits for bringing legal actions in India.\n* **Evidence Act:** The law governing the admissibility and weight of evidence in court.\n* **Statutory Obligation:** A legal obligation imposed by a statute. \n* **Conterminous:**  Meaning that two or more things are adjacent or touching. \n* **Encroachment:** The act of encroaching upon someone else's property. \n* **Conversion:** The act of wrongfully converting someone else's property. \n\n\nThis summary provides a comprehensive overview of the legal arguments and the court's decision in this complex coal mining dispute.",
        "reference": "The appellants and the respondents were owners of adjoining collieries and the suit out of which the present appeal arose was one brought by the respondents for certain reliefs on the allegation that the appellants had encroached upon their coal mines and removed coal from the encroached portion and that they came to know of the said encroachment and removal of coal after they had received the letter dated August 18, 1941, from the Inspector of Mines. The appellant denied the encroachment and pleaded that the suit was barred by limitation inasmuch as the respondents had knowledge of the encroachment in 1932 then there was a survey by the Department of Mines. The trial judge found on evidence that the proceedings in 1932 had nothing to do with the matter, held that article 48 of the Limitation Act applied to the suit and that the appellants had failed to prove that the respondents had knowledge of the sinking of the quarries and pits in the encroached land and decreed the suit. The High Court on appeal accepted the finding of the trial court and although it placed the burden of proving knowledge on the part of the respondents beyond the prescribed time on the appellants, nevertheless proceeded on the assumption that the initial burden to prove that they had knowledge of the said encroachment within the period was on the respondents and affirmed the decree of the trial court. Held, that the burden of proof had not been misplaced. Under article 48 of the Indian Limitation Act, which prescribes a three years ' limitation from the date of the knowledge, the initial onus is obviously on the plaintiff to prove that date since it would be within his special knowledge. Moreover, under section 3 of the Act, which makes its obligatory on the court to dismiss a suit barred by limitation, even though such a plea is not set up in defence, it is for the plaintiff to establish that the suit is not so barred.

Purporting to act under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders, the appellant terminated the services of S, without holding any departmental enquiry. The industrial tribunal to which the dispute was referred held, that action taken, after dropping the proposed departmental proceedings was not bonafide and was a colourable exercise of the powerconferred under r. 18(a) of the Standing order and since no attempt was made before it to defend such action by proving the alleged misconduct, it passed an order for reinstatement of S, The appellant contended that as the termination was strictly in accordance with the terms of contract under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders, it was entitled to dispense 823 with the service of an employee at any time by first giving 14 days notice or, paying 12 days wages. ^ Held, that the employer 's decision to discharge the employee under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders after dropping the enquiry intended to be held for misconduct was clearly a colourable exercise of the power, and an employer could not press his right purely on contract and say that under the contract he has unfettered right \"to hire and fire\" his employees, right was subject to industrial adjudication and even a power like that granted by r. 18(a) of the Standing orders in this case was subject to the scrutiny of industrial courts.

        "reference": "R and F who held a cinema building in Ahmedabad on lease entered on November 27, 1954 into an agreement with respondent No. 1 giving the latter a right to exhibit cinematograph films in the said building. Later respondent No. 1 filed 'suit No. 149 of 1960 to assert his right to exhibit films in the building. The suit resulted in a compromise decree. In pursuance of the compromise a further agreement dated December 1, 1960 was executed between the parties. However in 1963 respondent No. 1 again filed a suit claiming as a sub lessee or as lessee a right to exhibit films in the said building and praying that the defendants be restrained from interfering with that right. The suit was filed under section 28 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 in the Court of Small Causes. In this suit respondent No. 1 asked the court to try additional issues Nos. 11, 12 and 13 as preliminary issues. In issue No. 11 the question raised was whether the consent decree in the earlier suit operated as res judicata so that R & F could not question that the agreements between them and respondent No. 1 constituted a lease. Issue No. 12 raised the question whether in view of the consent decree R & F were estopped from leading evidence and asking questions in cross examination to show that the said agreements did not constitute a lease. Issue No. 13 raised the question whether section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act debarred R & F from leading evidence to the effect that the documents in question did not constitute a lease. The Trial Court refused to try these as preliminary issues and its order was upheld by the High Court. At the hearing of the case when the counsel for the defendants sought to ask a witness for respondent No. 1 whether the agreement dated November 27, 1954 was a commercial transaction and not a lease respondent No. 1 objected to the question. The objection was disallowed by the trial court. In revision under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure the High Court did not interfere with the trial court 's order in respect of issues Nos. 12 and 13. In respect of issue No. 11, the High Court held that the agreement dated November 27, 1954 must in view of the consent decree in suit No. 149 of 1960 be held to be a lease, and that the consent decree created a bar of res judicata in respect of the issue whether the said agreement created a lease. The defendants appellants appealed to this Court. HELD : (i) The High Court had no jurisdiction to record any finding on the issue of res judicata in a revision application filed against an order refusing to uphold an objection to certain question asked to a witness under examination. The Court erred in proceeding to decide matters on which no decision was till then recorded by the trial court and which could not be decided by the High Court until the parties had opportunity of leading evidence thereon. (ii) By ordering that a question may properly be put to a witness who was examined, no case was decided by the Trial Court within the meaning of section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The expression 'case ' is not limited in its import to the entirety of the matter in dispute in a proceeding. Such an interpretation may result in certain cases in denying relief to the aggrieved litigant where it is most needed. But equally, it is not every order of the court in the course of a suit that amounts to a case decided. A case may be said to be decided only if the court adjudicates, for the purpose of the suit, some right or obligation of the parties in controversy. [441H 442C] Major section section Khanna vs Brig. F. J, Dillon, [1964] 4 S.C.R. 409, referred to. (iii) A consent decree, according to the decisions of this Court, does not operate as res judicata, because a consent decree is merely the record of a contract between the parties to, a suit, to which is superadded the seal of the court. A matter in contest in a suit may operate as res judicata only if there is an adjudication by the court : the terms of section 1 1 of the Code leave no scope for a contrary view. [441E]"

His contract had a fixed term that could be extended, but was subject to the Governor's approval.\n* **Contractual Nature:** The contract was clearly defined, stating the period of employment and conditions. The contract was extended multiple times, but the final extension was due to expire on August 30, 1985.\n* **Termination:** Govil's service was terminated on March 29, 1985, with a one-month salary payment. The termination order was based on a Vigilance Report, and Govil was not given a chance to explain his side.\n* **Writ Petition:** Govil filed a Writ Petition challenging the termination, arguing that it was invalid. The High Court ruled in his favor, stating that the termination was invalid and Govil was entitled to salary until August 30, 1985.\n\n**The Appeal:**\n\n* **The Appeal:** The State of Uttar Pradesh appealed the High Court's decision, arguing that Govil's contract was a temporary appointment and that he was not entitled to continue beyond August 30, 1985.\n* **The High Court's Review:** The High Court reviewed its earlier decision and reinstated Govil, citing the interim order from July 10, 1986, which stated that the post would be kept vacant if Govil won his petition.\n* **The Appeal's Argument:** The State argued that the interim order did not give Govil a right to reinstatement, and that the High Court's decision was wrong.\n\n**The Court's Decision:**\n\n* **The Appeal is Allowed:** The Supreme Court overturned the High Court's decision on review, stating that the High Court's decision was based on an incorrect interpretation of the interim order.\n* **The High Court's Final Statement:** The Supreme Court acknowledged the High Court's statement in the final paragraph of its original judgment, which stated that the State could consider Govil's request for continued service or a fresh appointment.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Contractual Nature:** The case highlights the importance of understanding the terms of a contract, especially when it comes to employment.\n* **Limited Rights:** The case emphasizes that even if a contract is extended, it does not automatically grant someone a right to continue working indefinitely.\n* **Interim Orders:** The case shows that interim orders can have limited impact on final decisions, especially when they are not based on the merits of the case.\n* **Open to Interpretation:** The case demonstrates that the interpretation of legal documents can be complex and subject to different perspectives.\n\n\nThis case is a reminder that employment contracts are legally binding, and that termination of employment can be based on various factors, including the terms of the contract and the employer's discretion.",

But it was not right in making an order on Review on 26.7.1988 relying upon the interim order dated 10.7.1986 which ' in the circumstances could not have the effect of controlling the jurisdiction of the High Court to dispose of the Writ Petition on merits as it did on 24.3.1988. [245A B] 2. The interim order passed by the High Court did not and could not amount to a direction that the respondent was entitled to be reinstated in service irrespective of the merits of the case and the extent of his right. The order passed on review is wholly unsustainable. [245C]"

Here's a breakdown of the case and the court's decision:\n\n**Case Summary:**\n\n* **The Crime:** The appellant (accused) was charged with the murder of his wife, Subhadramma. \n* **The Prosecution's Case:** The prosecution alleged that the accused killed his wife by stabbing her with a knife. They presented evidence from witnesses who saw the accused at the scene, including the deceased's mother, brother, and neighbors. The medical evidence showed the stab wound was inflicted with force and was likely fatal.\n* **The Defense's Case:** The accused claimed he had no motive to kill his wife and that the events happened differently than the prosecution claimed. He argued that the injury could have been caused if she was standing, and that the prosecution was trying to make his mother-in-law appear as if she witnessed the crime.\n\n**The Court's Analysis:**\n\n* **High Court's Decision:** The High Court reversed the lower court's acquittal. They found that the High Court had erred in its assessment of the evidence. \n* **Key Points:**\n    * **Credibility of Witnesses:** The High Court found the testimony of the prosecution witnesses (PWs 1-3) to be credible and reliable. They were corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses who arrived at the scene shortly after the incident.\n    * **Medical Evidence:** The High Court found the medical evidence to support the prosecution's version of events, which was that the deceased was stabbed while lying down. The High Court rejected the defense's argument that the injury could have been caused if the deceased was standing.\n    * **Reasonable Doubt:** The High Court emphasized that the accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt. They found that the defense's arguments were based on \"fanciful possibilities\" and not on a reasonable doubt.\n    * **Appellate Court's Role:** The High Court stressed that the appellate court has the power to review the entire evidence and reach its own conclusion, even if there are two possible interpretations of the evidence.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* The High Court's decision was based on the belief that the lower court had erred in its assessment of the evidence and had been swayed by \"fanciful doubts.\" \n* The appeal was dismissed.\n\n\n**Legal Principles:**\n\n* **Benefit of Doubt:** The High Court emphasized the principle that the accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt.\n* **Two Views Possible:** The High Court acknowledged that in some cases, two reasonable views of the evidence are possible, but the accused is not entitled to the benefit of a doubt based on a mere possibility.\n* **Credibility of Evidence:** The High Court stressed the importance of considering the credibility of the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defense. \n* **Appellate Court's Role:** The High Court emphasized that the appellate court has the power to review the entire evidence and reach its own conclusion. \n\n\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThe High Court's decision was based on a thorough review of the evidence and a careful consideration of the legal principles involved. They found that the lower court had erred in its assessment of the evidence and had not properly applied the principles of criminal law.",
        "reference": "The appellant was charged with the offence of committing the murder of his wife. The trial court acquitted him on the ground that the prosecution had failed to establish any motive for the offence, that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses was discrepant, conflicting and improbable and that when two views were possible on the basis of two divergent versions given by the prosecution and the defence, the benefit of doubt should be given to the accused. The High Court reversed the order of acquittal and convicted and sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for life on the view that the trial court had magnified the importance to be attached to the discrepancies which were of a minor nature In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that in all cases where two views of the evidence were possible the accused was entitled to the benefit of doubt arising from the two views and that on this principle the High Court should not have interfered with the order of acquittal merely because another view was also possible. Dismissing the appeal: ^ HELD : (1) Where the trial court allows itself to be beset with fanciful doubts, rejects creditworthy evidence for slender reasons and takes a view of the evidence which is but barely possible, it is the obvious duty of the High Court to interfere in the interest of justice, lest the administration of justice be brought to ridicule. [370D] (2) After the decision of this Court in Sanwat Singh vs State of Rajasthan ; this Court has consistently recognised the right of the appellate court to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion bearing in mind the considerations mentioned by the Privy Council in Sheo Swarup vs Emperor (61 T.A. 389). Occasionally phrases like \"manifestly illegal\", \"grossly unjust have been used to describe the orders of acquittal which warrant interference. But such expressions have been used more as flourishes of language to emphasise the reluctance of the appellate court to interfere with an order of acquittal than to curtail the power of the appellate court to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion. In two other cases it has been held that to the principles laid down in Sanwat Singh 's case may added the further principle that if two 364 reasonable conclusions could be reached on the basis of the evidence on record the appellate court should not disturb the finding of the trial court. This principle stems out of the fundamental principle of our criminal jurisprudence that the accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt. If two reasonably probable and evenly balanced views of the evidence are possible one must necessarily concede the existence of a reasonable doubt. But fanciful and remote possibilities must be left out of account. To entitle an accused person to the benefit of a doubt arising from the possibility of duality of views, the possible view in favour of the accused must be as nearly reasonably probable as that against him. If the preponderance of probability is all one way, a bare possibility of another view will not entitle the accused to claim the benefit of any doubt. It is, therefore essential that, any view of the evidence in favour of the accused must be reasonable even as any doubt, the benefit of which an accused person may claim, must be reasonable. A reasonable doubt does not mean some light, airy, insubstantial doubt that may flit through the mind of a Judge about almost anything at any time or other, it does not mean a doubt begotten by sympathy out of reluctance to convict, it means a real doubt, a doubt founded upon reason. \"Proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" does not mean proof beyond a shadow of doubt The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man be to leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence, \"of course it is possible but not in the least probable,\" the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt but nothing short of that will suffice.

        "generated": "This legal document is a detailed summary of the arguments presented in a case concerning the power of the President to remove a Judge of the Supreme Court or High Court, and the ability of the judiciary to be prosecuted under the Prevention of Corruption Act. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**1. Definition of Public Servant:**\n\n* The court determines that a Judge of the Supreme Court or High Court is a public servant under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, as defined in Section 2 of the Act. This is based on the definition of \"public servant\" in Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n**2. Immunity of Judges:**\n\n* The court acknowledges that judges are immune from prosecution under Section 77 of the Indian Penal Code for acts done in the exercise of judicial functions. This immunity is based on the belief that judges should be free to make decisions without fear of reprisal.\n\n**3. Removal of Judges:**\n\n* The court clarifies that the removal of a judge from office is a complex process governed by Article 124 of the Constitution. This process requires an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority vote, and the President can only remove a judge for proved misbehaviour or incapacity.\n* The court emphasizes that the President cannot remove a judge without following the prescribed procedure outlined in Article 124.\n\n**4. Prosecution of Judges:**\n\n* The court examines the applicability of the Prevention of Corruption Act to judges. The court concludes that the Prevention of Corruption Act does not provide a mechanism for prosecuting judges for offenses committed during their tenure.\n* The court acknowledges that the Prevention of Corruption Act does not explicitly exempt judges from prosecution for offenses under Section 5(1)(e).\n\n**5. Impeachment vs. Removal:**\n\n* The court compares the impeachment process in the United States with the removal process in India. The US system allows for impeachment for \"Treason, Bribery or other high Crimes and misdemeanours,\" while India's system focuses on removal for \"proved misbehaviour or incapacity.\"\n* The court emphasizes that the US system allows for impeachment even for offenses that may not be indictable, while India's system is more limited.\n\n**6.  Sanction for Prosecution:**\n\n* The court discusses the need for a mechanism to ensure that judges are prosecuted for corruption. The court acknowledges that the current system does not provide for such a mechanism.\n\n**7.  Presumption of Innocence:**\n\n* The court emphasizes that judges are presumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThe court's decision is a complex one, balancing the need for judicial independence with the need to ensure accountability for corrupt practices. The court ultimately concludes that the Prevention of Corruption Act does not provide a mechanism for prosecuting judges, and that the removal process outlined in Article 124 of the Constitution is the appropriate mechanism for addressing allegations of misconduct.",
        "reference": "A complaint against the appellant, a former Chief Jus tice of a High Court, was made to the CBI on which a case under section 5(2) read with section 5( I )(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 was registered on 24.2.1976. On 28.2.1976 the F.I.R. was filed in the court of Special Judge. The appellant proceeded on leave from 9.3.1976 and retired 8.4.1976 on attaining the age of superannuation. The investigation culminated in the filing of charge sheet/final report under section 173(2), Cr. P.C. against the appellant on 15.12.1977 before the Special Judge. The Charge sheet stated that the appellant after assum ing office of the Chief Justice on 1.5.1969 gradually com menced accumulation of assets and was in possession of pecuniary resources and property, in his name and in the names of his wife and two sons, disproportionate to his known sources of income for the period between the date of his appointment as Chief Justice and the date of registra tion of the case, and thereby he committed the offence of criminal misconduct under section 5( 1 )(e), punishable under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. The Special judge issued process for appearance of the appellant. Mean while, the appellant moved the High Court under section 482, Cr. P.C. to quash the said criminal proceedings. The matter was heard by a Full Bench of the High Court which dismissed the application by 2:1 majority; but granted a certificate under Articles 132(1) and 134(1)(c) of the Constitution in view of the important question of law in volved. In appeal to this Court it was contended by the appel lant that the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 do not apply to a judge of a superior Court as for such prosecution previous sanction of an authority competent to remove a public servant as provided under section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 is imperative and power to remove a Judge is not vested in any single individual authority but is 191 vested in the two Houses of Parliament and the President under Article 124(4) of the Constitution; that the Parlia ment cannot be the sanctioning authority for the purpose of section 6 and if the President is regarded as the authority, he cannot act independently as he exercises his powers by and with the advice of his Council of Ministers and the Execu tive may 'misuse the power by interfering with the judici ary; that section 6 applies only in cases where there is master and servant relationship between the public servant and the authority competent to remove him, and where there is verti cal hierarchy of public offices and the sanctioning authori ty. is vertically superior in the hierarchy in which office of the public servant against whom sanction is sought ex ists; that no prosecution can be launched against a Judge of a superior Court under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act except in the mode envisaged by Article 124(4) of the Constitution; that no law prohibits a public servant having in his possession assets disproportionate to his known sources of income and such possession becomes an offence only when the public servant is unable to account for it; and that the public servant is entitled to an oppor tunity by the investigating officer to explain dispropor tionality between the assets and the known sources of income and the charge sheet must contain such an averment, and failure to mention that requirement would vitiate the charge sheet and render it invalid and, no offence under section 5(1)(e) of the Act could be made out. On the questions: (1) whether a Judge of a High Court or of the Supreme Court is a 'public servant ' within the mean ing of section 2 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947; (2) whether a Judge of the High Court including the Chief Jus tice, or a Judge of the Supreme Court can be prosecuted for an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947; and (3) who is the competent authority to remove a Judge either of the Supreme Court or of the High Court from his office in order to enable that authority to grant sanction for prose cution of the Judge under the provisions of section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: (Per Majority Ray, Shetty, Sharma and Venkatachaliah, JJ). A Judge of a High Court or of the Supreme Court is a 'public servant ' within the meaning of section 2 of the Preven tion of Corruption Act, 1947. Prosecution of a Judge of a High Court, including the Chief 192 Justice, or a Judge of the Supreme Court can be launched after obtaining sanction of the competent authority as envisaged by section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Per Verma, J. (dissenting) 1. (i) A Judge or Chief Justice of a High Court is a Constitutional functionary, even though he holds a public office and in that sence he may be included in the wide definition of a public servant. But a public servant whose category for the grant of sanction for prosecution is not envisaged by section 6 of the Act is outside the purview of the Act, not intended to be covered by the Act. 1(ii) The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, as amended by the 1964 amendment is inapplicable to Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court. (Per Majority Ray, Shetty and Venkatachaliah, JJ.) 3.1 For the purpose of section 6(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, the President of India is the authori ty competent to give previous sanction for prosecution of a Judge of a superior Court. 3.2 No criminal case shall be registered under section 154, Cr. P.C. against a Judge of the High Court, Chief Justice of the High Court or a Judge of the Supreme Court unless the Chief Justice of India is consulted in the matter. 3.3 If the Chief Justice of India himself is the person against whom the allegations of criminal misconduct are received, the Government shall consult any other judge or Judges of the Supreme Court. 3.4 There shall be similar consultation at the stage of examining the question of granting sanction for prosecution and it shall be necessary and appropriate that the question of sanction be guided by and in accordance with the advice of the Chief Justice of India. Sharma. J. (contra) As to who is precisely the authority for granting previ ous sanction for prosecution of a Judge is a matter which did not arise in the instant case and will have to be final ly decided when it directly arises. How 193 ever, the issues of removal under article 124(4) of the Consti tution and sanction under section 6 of the Act can be combined for getting clearance from the Parliament. Verma. J. (dissenting) 3. Section 6 of the Act is inapplicable to Judges of High Courts or of the Supreme Court and such Constitutional functionaries do not fail within the purview of the Preven tion of Corruption Act, 1947. Per B.C. Ray, J. 1. A Judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court comes within the definition of public servant under section 2 of the Prevention of corruption Act, 1947. and he is liable to be prosecuted under the provisions of the Act. [223E F] 2.1 A Judge will be liable for committing criminal misconduct within the meaning of section 5(1)(e) of the Act, if he has in his possession pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his known sources of income for which he cannot satisfactorily account. [217B] 2.2 A Judge of a superior Court will not be immune from prosecution for criminal offences committed during the tenure of his office under the provisions of the Act. [223F] 3.1 In order to launch a prosecution against a Judge of a superior Court for criminal misconduct failing under section 5(1)(e) of the Act, previous sanction of the authority competent to remove a Judge, including Chief Justice of a High Court, from his office is imperative. [217C D; 221G] 3.2 The President of India has the power to appoint as well as to remove a Judge from his office on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity as provided in Article 124 of the Constitution and, therefore he, being the authority competent to appoint and to remove a Judge, of course, in accordance with the procedure envisaged in clauses(4) and (5) of Article 124. may be deemed to be the authroity to grant sanction for prosecution of a Judge under the provi sions of section 6(1)(c) in respect of the offences provided in section 5(1)(e) of the Act. [225G H; 226A B] 3.3 In order to adequately protect a Judge from frivo lous prosecution and unnecessary harassment the President will consult the Chief Justice of India who will consider all the materials placed before 194 him and tender his advice to the President for giving sanc tion to launch prosecution or for filing FIR against the Judge concerned after being satisfied in the matter. The President shall act in accordance with the advice given by the Chief Justice of India. [226B C] If the Chief Justice of India is of opinion that it is not a fit case for grant of sanction for prosecution of the Judge concerned, the President shall not accord sanction to prosecute the Judge. This will save the ,fudge concerned from unnecessary harassment as well as from frivolous prose cution against him. [226C] In the case of the Chief justice of the Supreme Court, the President shall consult such of the Judges of the Su preme Court as he may deem fit and proper and shall act in accordance with the advice given to him by the Judge or Judges of the Supreme Court. [226D] 3.4 In the instant case, the appellant had resigned from his office and ceased to be a public servant on the date of lodging the F.I.R. against him by the C.B.I. and, therefore, no sanction under section 6(1)(c) of the Act was necessary. [227A; 228C] R.S. Nayak vs A.R. Antulay, ; , referred to. 4.1 A Judge of the Supreme Court as well as a Judge of the High Court is a constitutional functionary and to main tain the independence of the judiciary and to enable the Judge to effectively discharge his duties as a judge and to maintain the rule of law, even in respect of against the Central Government or the State Government, he is made totally independent of the control and influence of the executive by mandatorily embodying in Article 124 or Article 217 of the Constitution that a Judge can only be removed from his office in the manner provided in clauses (4) and (5) of Article 124. [222B D] 4.2 Power to remove by impeachment or address, a person holding office during good behaviour, is an essential coun terpart to the independence secured to the holders of high office by making their tenure one of good behaviour instead of at pleasure. [224D E] 4.3 A Judge of the Supreme Court or of the High Court can only be removed on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity by an order of the President passed after follow ing the mandatory procedure expressly laid down in Article 124(4) of the Constitution. Without an address by each of the Houses of the Parliament, the President is not 195 empowered under the Constitution to order removal of a Judge of the Supreme Court or of the High Court from his office on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. Therefore, the repository of this power is not in the President alone but it is exercised after an address by each of the Houses of Parliament in the manner provided in Article 124(4). [218B H; 219A] Union of India vs Sakalchand, ; and S.P. Gupta and Ors. vs President of India and Ors, AIR 1982 SC 149, referred to. There is no master and servant relationship or employer and employee relationship between a Judge and the President of India in whom the executive power of the Union is vested under the provisions of Article 53 of the Consti tution. [222E] 6. It is necessary to evolve some method commensurate with the grant of sanction in cases of serious allegations of corruption and acquisition or the possession of dispro portionate assets which the Judge cannot satisfactory ac count for or possession of property disproportionate to the sources of income of the Judge. Otherwise, it will create a serious inroad on the dignity, respect and credibility and integrity of the high office which a superior ,fudge occu pies resulting in the erosion of the dignity and respect for the high office of the Judges in the estimation of the public. [225E F] 7.1 The purpose of grant of previous sanction before prosecuting a public servant including a Judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court is to protect the Judge from unnecessary harassment and frivolous prosecution more par ticularly to save the Judge from the biased prosecution for giving judgment in a case which goes against the Government or its officers though based on good reasons and rule of law. [226D E] 7.2 Frivolous prosecution cannot be launched against a Judge for giving a judgment against the Central Government or any of its officers inasmuch as such decision does not amount to misbehaviour within the meaning of Article 124 of the Constitution. [226G H] Shamsher Singh & Ant. vs State of Punjab, ; and G.K. Daphtary vs O.P. Gupta; , , re ferred to. Per Shetty, and Venkatachaliah, JJ. 196 1. The expression \"public servant\" as defined under section 2 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 means a public serv ant as defined in section 21, I.P.C. From the very commencement of the I.P.C. \"Every Judge\" finds a place in the categories of public servant defined under section 21 and this expression indicates all Judges and all Judges of all Courts. It is a general term and general term in the Act should not be narrowly construed. It must receive comprehensive meaning unless there is positive indication to the contrary. There is no such indication to the contrary in the Act. A Judge of the superior Court cannot therefore excluded from the defi nition of 'public servant '. [237C; 240D; 242A B] 2.1 A public servant cannot be prosecuted for offences specified in section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, unless there is prior sanction under section 6 for prosecution from the competent authority. [237E] 2.2 There are two requirements for the applicability of clause (c) of section 6(1) to a Judge of the higher judiciary the Judge must be a public servant, and there must be an authority competent to remove him from his of fice. If these two requirements are complied with, a Judge cannot escape from the operation of the Act. [240B C] 2.3 The Judges are liable to be dealt with just the same way as any other person in respect of criminal offence. It is only in taking of bribes or with regard to the offence of corruption the sanction for criminal prosecution is re quired. There is no law providing protection for Judges from criminal prosecution. [252A B] It is not objectionable to initiate criminal proceedings against public servant before exhausting the disciplinary proceedings, and a fortiori, the prosecution of a Judge for criminal misconduct before his removal by Parliament for proved misbehaviour is unobjectionable. [252D E] The \"proved misbehaviour\" which is the basis for removal of a Judge under clause (4) of Article 124 of the Constitu tion may also in certain cases involve an offence of crimi nal misconduct under section 5(1) of the Act. But that is no ground for withholding criminal prosecution till the Judge is removed by Parliament. One is the power of Parliament and the other is the jurisdiction of a criminal court. Both are mutually exclusive. [251A C] 3.1 For the purpose of section 6(1)(c) of the Act, the President of India the authority competent to give previous sanction for the prosecution 197 of a Judge of the Supreme Court and the High Court. 3.2 Section 6(1) brings within its fold all the catego ries of public servants as defined in section 21 of the I.P.C. Clauses (a) and (b) would cover the cases of public servants who are employed in connection with the affairs of the Union or State and are not removable from their office save by or with the sanction of the respective government. Clause (c) states that in the case of any other person the sanction would be of the authority competent to remove him from his office. [238E F] The provisions of clauses (a) and (b) of section 6 [(1)] cover certain categories of public servants and the 'other ' which means remaining categories are brought within the scope of clause (c). Clause (c) is independent of and sepa rate from the preceding two clauses. The structure of the section does not permit the applicability of the rule of ejusdem generis. [240A B] 3.3 The application of the ejusdem generis rule is only to general word following words which are less general, or the general word following particular and specific words of the same nature. In such a case, the general word or expres sion is to be read as comprehending only things of the same kind as that designated by the preceding specific words or expressions. The general word is presumed to be restricted to the same genus as those of the particular and specific words. [239F G] 3.4 The construction which would promote the general legislative purpose underlying the provision, is to be preferred to a construction which would not. [247A] If the literal meaning of the legislative language used would lead to results which would defeat the purpose of the Act, the Court would be justified in disregarding the liter al meaning and adopt a liberal construction which effectu ates the object of the legislature. [247A B] S.A. Venkataraman vs The State, ; and M. Narayanan vs State of Kerala, ; , referred to. Craies on Statute Law, (6th Edn. p. 531) referred to. 3.5 In view of the composition of Parliament, the nature of transacting business or proceeding in each House, the prohibition by Article 121 on discussion with respect to the conduct of any Judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court, in the discharge of his duties except 198 upon a motion for presenting an address to the President praying for his removal, the Parliament cannot be the proper authority for granting sanction for the prosecution of a Judge, That does not, however, follow that the Judges of superior Courts are entitled to be excluded from the scope of the Act. [245C F] 3.6 Section 6 requires to be liberally construed. It is not a penal provision but a measure of protection to public servants in the penal enactment. It indicates the authori ties without whose sanction a public servant cannot be prosecuted. It is sufficient that the authorities prescribed thereunder fail within the fair sense of the language of the section. [247B C] The expression \"the authority competent to remove\" used in section 6(1)(c) is to be construed to mean also an authority without whose order or affirmation the public servant cannot be removed. The order of the President for removal of a Judge is mandatory. The motion passed by each House of Parliament with the special procedure prescribed under article 124(4) will not proprio vigore operate against the Judge. It will not have the consequence of removing the Judge from the office unless it is followed by an order of the President. Clause (4) of article 124 is in the negative terms. The order of the President is sine qua non for removal of a Judge. The President alone could make that order. [247C E, 248C] 3.7 The relationship of master and servant as is ordi narily understood in common law does not exist between the Judges of higher judiciary and the Government. The Judges are not bound nor do they undertake to obey any order of the Government within the scope of their duties. Indeed, they are not Judges if they allow themselves to be guided by the Government in the performance of their duties. [239B D] Union of India vs H.S. Seth, ; , referred to. 3.8 It is not necessary that the authority competent to give sanction for prosecution or the authority competent to remove the public servant should be vertically superior in the hierarchy in which the office of the public servant exists. There is no such requirement under section 6 of the Act. The power to give sanction for prosecution can be conferred on any authority. Such authority may be of the department in which the public servant is working or an outside authority. All that is required is that the authority must be in a position to appreciate the materials collected against the public servant to judge whether the prosecution contemplated is frivolous or speculative. [249B C] 199 R.S. Nayak vs A.R. Antulay, , distinguished. The President is not an outsider so far judiciary is concerned. He appoints the Judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court in exercise of his executive powers. [249E] Shamsher Singh vs State of Punjab, [1975] 1 SCR 365 and S.P. Gupta vs Union of India, [1982] 2 SCR 365, referred to. Parliament has no part to play in the matter of appoint ment of Judges except that the Executive is responsible to the Parliament. [249G H] 3.9 In the instant case, the view taken by the High Court that no sanction for prosecution of the appellant under section 6 of the Act was necessary since he had retired from the service on the age of superannuation and was not a public servant on the date of filing the charge sheet, is unassailable. The question is no longer res integra. [254G H; 255C] S.A. Venkataraman vs The State, ; ; C.R. Bansi vs State of Maharashtra, ; and K.S. Dharmadatan vs Central Government & Ors., ; , referred to. R.S. Nayak & Ors vs A.R. Antulay, , referred to. 4.1 There are various protections afforded to Judges to preserve the independence of the judiciary. They have pro tection from civil liability for any act done or ordered to be done by them in discharge of their judicial duty whether or not such judicial duty is performed within the limits of their jurisdiction, as provided under section 1 of . Likewise section 77, I.P.C. gives them protection from criminal liability for an act performed judicially. A discussion on the conduct of the Judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts in the discharge of their duties shall not take place in Parliament or in the State Legislatures, as envisaged by Articles 121 and 211 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court and the High Courts have been constituted as Courts of Record with the power to punish for committing contempt as laid down by Articles 129 and 215. The provides power to take civil and criminal contempt proceedings. The Executive is competent to appoint the Judges but not empowered to remove them. The power to remove is vested in Parliament by the process analogous to impeachment as envisaged by Article 124 of the Constitution. [251E H; 242E] 200 4.2 Previous sanction of the competent authority as contem plated by section 6 is only to protect the honest public servants from frivolous and vexatious prosecution. The competent authority may refuse sanction for prosecution if the offence alleged has no material to support or it is frivolous or intended to harass the honest officer. But he is duty bound to grant sanction if the material collected lend credence to the offence complained of the discretion to prosecute a public servant is taken away from the prosecuting agency and is vested in the authority competent to remove the public servant. The latter would be in a better position than the prosecuting agency to assess the material collected in a dispassionate and reasonable manner and determine whether or not the sanction for prosecution deserves to be granted. [237F G; 238A C] 4.3 The apprehension, that the Executive being the largest litigant is likely to misuse the power to prosecute the Judges, in our overlitigious society is pot unjustified or unfounded. The Act provides certain safeguards like section 6 and trial by the court which is independent of the Executive. But these safeguards may not be adequate. Any complaint against a Judge and its investigation by the CBI, if given publicity, will have a far reaching impact on the Judge and the litigant public. The need therefore is a judicious use of taking action under the Act. Care should be taken that honest and fearless Judges are not harassed. They should be protected. [252G H; 253A C] 5.1 There is no need for a separate legislation for the Judges. The Act is not basically defective in its applica tion to judiciary. All that is required is to lay down certain guidelines lest the Act may be misused. This Court being the ultimate guardian of rights of people and inde pendence of the judiciary will not deny itself the opportu nity to lay down such guidelines. This Court is not a Court of limited jurisdiction of only dispute settling. Almost from the beginning, this Court has been a law maker, albiet, 'interstitial ' law maker. Indeed the Court 's role today is much more. It is expanding beyond dispute settling and interstitial law making. It is a problem solver in the nebulous areas. [253E G] 5.2 The Chief Justice of India is a participatory func tionary in the matter of appointment of Judges of the Su preme Court and the High Courts; he is to be consulted by the President of India even for transfer of a Judge from one High Court to another; and question of age of a Judge of a High Court shall be decided by the President after consult ing him. The Chief Justice of India being the head of the Judiciary is primarily concerned with the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. Hence it is necessary that the Chief Justice of India is not 203 either from the evidence of the prosecution and/or evidence from the defence. [259F G] 8.3 Parliament is competent to place the burden on certain aspects on the accused as well and particularly in matters \"especially within his knowledge\". (section 106 of the Evidence Act). Adroitly the prosecution cannot, in the very nature of things, be expected to know the affairs of a public servant found in possession of resources of property disproportionate to his known sources of income. It is for him to explain. Such a statute placing burden on the accused cannot be regarded as unreasonable, unjust, or unfair. Nor can it be regarded as contrary to Article 21 of the Consti tution. The principle that the burden of proof is always on the prosecution and never shifts to the accused is not a universal rule to be followed in every case. The principle is applied only in the absence of statutory provision to the contrary. [260A C] Woolmington vs Director of Public Prosecution, [1935] A .C. 462; C.S.D. Swamy vs The State, ; ; Surajpal Singh vs The State of U.P., ; ; Sajjan Singh vs The State of Punjab, ; ; Rig vs Hunt, and Maharashtra vs K.K.S. Ramas wamy; , , referred to. State of Maharashtra vs Wasudeo Ramchandra Kaidalwar, ; , referred to. 9.1 To state that after collection of all material, the investigating officer must give an opportunity to the ac cused and call upon him to account for the excess of the assets over the known sources of income and then decide whether the accounting is satisfactory or not, would be elevating him to the position of an enquiry officer or a judge. He is not holding an enquiry against the conduct of the public servant or determining the disputed issues re garding the disproportionality between the assets and the income of the accused. He just collects material from all sides and prepares a report which he files in the Court as a chargesheet. The investigating officer is only required to collect material to find out whether the offence alleged appears to have been committed. In the course of the inves tigation, he may examine the accused. Indeed, fair investi gation requires that the accused should not be kept in darkness. He should be taken into confidence if he is will ing to cooperate. [261B E] 10.1 The charge sheet is nothing but a final report of the police officer under section 173(2) of the Cr. P.C. Section 173(2) provides that on 204 completion of the investigation the police officer investi gating into a cognizable Offence shall submit a report, which must be in the form prescribed by the State Govern ment. The statutory requirement of the report under section 173(2) would be complied with if the various details pre scribed therein are included in the report and it accompa nies all the documents and statements of witnesses as re quired by section 172(5) Cr. P.C. Nothing more need be stated in the report of the investigating officer. It is also not necessary that all the details of the offence must be stat ed. The details of the offence are required to be proved to bring home the guilt of the accused at a later stage in the course of the trial of the case by adducing acceptable evidence. [261E H; 262A C] Satya Narain Musadi and Ors. vs State of Bihar, , referred to. 10.2 In the instant case, the charge sheet contained all the requirements of section 173(2), Cr. It stated that the investigation showed that between 1.5.1969 and 24.2.1976 the appellant had been in possession of the pecuniary resources and property in his own name and in the names of his wife and two sons, which were disproportionate to the known sources of income over the same period and he cannot satis factorily account for such disproportionate pecuniary re sources and property. The details of properties and pecuni ary resources of the appellant also were set out in clear terms. No more was required to be stated in the charge sheet. It was fully in accordance with the terms of section 173(2), Cr. P.C. and clause (e) ors. 5(1)(e) of the Act. [262C E] 11. The society 's demand for honesty in a Judge is exacting and absolute. The standards of judicial behaviour, both on and off the Bench, are normally extremely high. For a judge to deviate from such standards of honesty and impar tiality is to betray the trust reposed on him. No excuse or no legal relativity can condone such betrayal. From the standpoint of justice the size of the bribe or scope of corruption cannot be the scale for measuring a judge 's dishonour. A single dishonest judge not only dishonours himself and disgraces his office but jeopardises the integ rity of the entire judicial system. [262F H; 263A] A judicial scandal has always been regarded as far more deplorable than a scandal involving either the Executive or a member of the Legislature. The slightest hint of irregu larity or impropriety in the Court is a cause for great anxiety and alarm. [263A B] Per Sharma, J.: 1. The expression \"public servant\" used in the Prevention of 205 Corruption Act, 1947 is undoubtedly wide enough to denote every Judge, including the Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court [263D] 2.1 Section 2 of the Act adopts the definition of \"public servant\" as given in section 21, I.P.C. which includes \"Every Judge\". If the legislature had intended to exclude Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court from the field of section 5 of the Act, it could have said so in unambigu ous terms instead of adopting the wide meaning of the ex pression \"public servant\" as given in the Indian Penal Code. [266E F] 2.2 No person is above the law. In a proceeding under Article 124 of the Constitution, a Judge can merely be removed from his office. He cannot be convicted and pun ished. In a case where there is a positive finding recorded in such a proceeding against the Judge and on that ground he is removed from his office, it cannot be said that he will escape the criminal liability. In a civilised society the law cannot be assumed to be leading to such disturbing results. [265G; 266A B] 2.3 It is not safe to assume that the Prevention of Corruption Act intended to make in its application any discrimination between the lower and the higher judiciary. There cannot be any rational ground on the basis of which a member of a higher judiciary may be allowed to escape prose cution while in identical circumstances a member of the subordinate judiciary is tried and convicted. Such an inter pretation of the Act will militate against its constitution al validity and should not, therefore, be preferred. [265C E] 3.1 The power to remove a High Court Judge from his office does exist and has to be exercised in appropriate circumstances according to the provisions of Article |24 of the Constitution. It cannot, therefore be said that previous sanction for his prosecution cannot be made available. [266D E] 3.2 Section 6(1)(c) of the Act speaks of the \"authority competent to remove\" the public servant \"from his office\". An answer in the negative to the question as to whether there is some authority competent to remove a Judge of a High Court will be inconsistent with Article 124 clauses (4) and (5) read with Article 218 of the Constitution. Although more than one person are involved in the process, it is not permissible to say that no authority exists for the purpose of exercising the power to remove a High Court Judge from his office. [264A C] As to who is precisely the authority in this regard is a matter 206 which does not arise in the instant case, but the vital question whether such an authority exists at all must be answered in the affirmative. [264C D] 4.1 If the President is held to be the appropriate authority to grant the sanction without reference to the Parliament, he will be bound by the advice he receives from the Council of Ministers. This will seriously jeopardise the independence of judiciary which is undoubtedly a basic feature of the Constitution. [267D E] 4.2 Since the Constitution itself has considered it adequate in the matter of dealing with serious accusations against the Judges by incorporating the provisions of clauses (4) and (5) in Article 124, they must be treated to be appropriate and suitable; and should be resorted to in the matter of prosecution also, in view of the Parliament enacting section 6 of the Act in the language which attracts the constitutional ,provisions. [268B C] 4.3 It is true that the grant of sanction will be de layed until the accusation is examined according to the law enacted under Clause (5) of Article 124, but once that stage is over and a finding is recorded against the Judge, there should not be any hitch in combining the two matters the removal and the grant of sanction which are obviously inter twined, for getting clearance from Parliament. [268E H; 269A] 5.1 Protection to the public servant in general is provided under Article 311 of the Constitution and the interest of the subordinate judiciary is further taken care of by the High Courts, and this alongwith the provisions regarding previous sanction shields them from unjustified prosecution. Similarly, protection is available to the High Court and Supreme Court Judges through the provisions of clauses (4) and (5) of Article 124 of the Constitution. So far this aspect is concerned, the two categories of Judges High Court and Supreme Court Judges on the one hand and the rest on the other have not been treated by the law differently. [265C E] 5.2 The protection to the independence of the Judiciary is in section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, which by providing for previous sanction of the authority empowered to remove the Judge, leads to Article 124 of the Constitution. [268A B] 6.1 Taking into consideration the independence of Judi ciary as envisaged by the Constitution, if the President of India is treated as the sanctioning authority in the case of a Judge, and the Chief Justice of 207 India is consulted in the matter and steps are taken in accordance with his advice, and the executive follows this rule strictly, a further protection from harassment of the Judges is uncalled for and unjustified criminal prosecution shall be not made available. But such a binding direction cannot be issued by this Court on the basis of the provi sions of the Constitution and the Act. The approval of the Chief Justice of India can be introduced as a condition for prosecution only by the Parliament and not by this Court. If the Court starts supplementing the law as it stands now, it will be encroaching upon the legislative field. [266G H; 267A B; F H; 268A] 7. Section 5(1)(e) does not contemplate a notice to be served on the accused. If the prosecuting authority after making a suitable enquiry, by taking into account the rele vant documents and questioning relevant persons, forms the opinion that the accused cannot satisfactorily account for the accumulation of disproportionate wealth in his posses sion the section is attracted. [269B D] 8. In the instant case, the records clearly indicate that after duly taking all the appropriate steps it was stated that the assets found in the possession of the appel lant in his own name and in the names of his wife and two sons, were disproportionate to his known sources of income during the relevant period and for which he \"cannot satis factorily account\". [269D E] Per Verma, J. (dissenting) 1.1 A Judge or Chief justice of a High Court is a Con stitutional functionary, even though he holds a public office and in that sense he may be included in the wide definition of a 'public servant '. However, the holder of an office who may be a public servant according to the wide definition of the expression in the prevention of corruption Act, but whose category for grant of sanction for prosecu tion is not envisaged by section 6 is outside the purview of the Act, not intended to be covered by the Act. [289F; 286D E] 1.2 Section 6(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, is inapplicable to a Judge of a High Court or the Supreme Court and such constitutional functionaries do not fall within the purview of the Act. [296B] 1.3 Previous sanction under section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, is a condition precedent for taking cognizance of an offence punishable under the Act, of a public servant who is prosecuted during 208 his continuance in the office. The public servant failing within the purview of the Act must invariably fail within one of the three clauses in section 6(1). If the holder of an office, even though a public servant according to the defi nition in the Act does not fail within any of the clauses (a), (b) or (c) of sub section (1), he must be deemed to be outside the purview of the Act since this special enactment was not enacted to cover that category of public servants in spite of the wide definition of 'public servant ' in the Act. [286A B] 1.4 Section 6(1)(c) speaks of 'authority competent to remove ', which plainly indicates the substantive competence of the authority to remove, not merely the procedural or formal part of it. The authority itself should be competent to remove or the one to decide the question of removal and not one which merely obeys or implements the decision of some other authority. It contemplates that the removing authority should have the competence to take a decision on the material placed before it for the purpose of deciding whether the public servant, against whom sanction is sought, has been prima facie guilty of abuse of his office so that there is occasion to bring about cessation of interrelation between the office and abuse by the holder of the office by his removal therefrom. [291A C] R.S. Nayak vs A.R. Antulay, , referred to. 1.5 The competent sanctioning authority envisaged by section 6( 1 )(c) is a vertical superior in the hierarchy having some power of superintendence over the functioning of the public servant. Where no such relationship exists in the absence of any vertical hierarchy and the holder of the public office is a constitutional functionary not subject to power of superintendence of any superior, section 6 can have no application by virtue of the scheme engrafted therein. [291C D] 1.6 Construction of section 6(1)(c) of the Act treating the President as the competent authority to remove a High Court Judge would conflict with the provisions enacted in clauses (4) and (5) of Article 124 read with Article 218 of the Constitution. Such a construction has to be avoided. [295B C] 1.7 The Prevention of Corruption Act is wholly workable in its existing form for the public servants within its purview and there is no impediment in its applicability to the large number of public servants who have been dealt with thereunder ever since its enactment. [274A] 209 1.8 In view of the special provisions enacted in clauses (4) and (5) of Article 124 read with Article 218 of the Constitution, non application of section 6(1) of the Preven tion of Corruption Act, 1947 to the Constitutional function aries such as Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court, would result only in the failure of the attempt to bring them within the purview of the Act, while the Act would continue to apply to the public servants in general who fail within the scheme of section 6 of the Act 1or the pur pose of grant of previous sanction for prosecution which is a condition precedent for cognizance of an offence punisha ble under that Act. [295A E] 2.1 The construction made of the provisions of the Act must also fit in within the scheme of clauses (4) and (5) of Article 124 read with Article 218 of the Constitution in order to present a harmonious scheme. [294C B] 2.2 There can be no doubt that the expression 'misbeha viour ' is of wide import and includes within its ambit criminal miscondust as defined in sub section (1) of section 5 of the Act as also lesser misconduct of a Judge falling short of criminal misconduct. The special law envisaged by Article 124(5) for dealing with the misbehaviour of a Judge covers the field of 'investigation ' and 'proof ' of the 'misbeha viour and the only punishment provided is by Article 124(4) of removal from office. [294D E] 2.3 Article 124(5) of the Constitution is wide enough to include within its ambit every conduct of a Judge amounting to misbehaviour including criminal misconduct and prescribes the procedure for investigation and proof thereof. [294E] 2.4 Even for the procedure for investigation into any misbehaviour of a Judge as well as its proof, a law enacted by the Parliament under Article 124(5) is envisaged in the constitutional scheme. Such a law in the form of the and the Rules framed thereunder has been enacted. These provisions were made in the Constitution and the law thereunder enacted when the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 was in the statute book. [294F G] 2.5 The prior enactment and existence of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 at the time when clauses (4) and (5) of Article 124 of the Constitution were framed, does indi cate the constitutional scheme that a separate parliamentary law to deal with the investigation and proof of misbehaviour of a Judge was clearly contemplated by providing a special machinery for this category of constitutional func 210 tionaries notwithstanding the general law available and applicable to the public servants in general, which included the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. [294G H; 295A] 2.6 In view of the special provisions in the form of clauses (4) and (5) of Article 124 and Article 218 of the Constitution, and the special enactment by the Parliament under Article 124 (5) provided in the Constitutional scheme for Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court, it cannot be said that they are governed by the general provi sions in addition to these special provisions enacted only for them. The need for these special provisions is a clear pointer in the direction of inapplicability to them of the general provisions applicable to the public servants holding other public offices, not as constitutional functionaries. [295A B] 2.7 The view that Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court are outside the purview of the Prevention of Corruption Act, fits in with the constitutional scheme and is also in harmony with the several nuances of the entire existing law relating to the superior Judges while the contrary view fouls with it at several junctures and leaves many gaping holes which cannot be filled by judicial exer cise. [303F G] 2.8 The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, as amended by the 1964 amendment, is inapplicable to Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court. [304A] $ 84, referred to. 3.1 There is practical difficulty in applying criminal misconduct, defined in clause (e) of sub section (1) of section 5 of the Act to a Judge of a High Court or the Supreme Court. [296C] 3.2 The words in clause (e) of section 5 (1) of the Act have to be given some meaning which would place the burden on the prosecution, howsoever light, to make out a prima facie case for obtaining sanction of the competent authority under section 6 of the Act and this can be done only if it is read as a part of the scheme under which the public servant is required to furnish particulars of his assets with reference to which the disproportion and his inability to satisfactorily ac count can be inferred. [297A B] 3.3 While according sanction to prosecute under section 6 of the Act, the competent authority has to satisfy itself about the public servant 's inability to satisfactorily account for possession of disproportionate assets. The competent author ity before granting sanction has to apply 211 its mind and be satisfied about the existence of a prima facie case for prosecution of the public servant on the basis of the material placed before it. In order to form an objective opinion, the competent authority must have before it the version of the public servant on the basis of which the conclusion can be reached whether it amounts to satis factory account or not. [296E F] 3.4 The rules applicable to the public servants in general regulating their conduct require them to furnish periodical information of their assets which form a part of their service record. In the case of such public servants whenever sanction to prosecute is sought under section 6, the competent authority can form the requisite opinion on the basis of the available material including the service record of the public servant to code to the conclusion whether the offence under clause (e) of section 5 (1) of possession of dis proportionate assets which the public servant cannot satis factorily account is made outprima facie. [296F G, 297C D] 3.5 In the case of Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court, there is no requirement under any provision of furnishing particulars of their assets so as to provide a record thereof with reference to which such an opinion can be formed and there is no vertical superior with legal authority enabling obtaining of information from the con cerned Judge. This too is a pointer in the direction that even after the 1964 amendment of the Act the Legislature did not intend to include Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court within the purview of the enactment. [297D F] 4.1 If the Act is applicable to Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court, it is obvious that the same must apply also to the Chief Justice of India, the Comptrol ler and Auditor General and the Chief Election Commissioner. Incongruous results would follow in such an event. [297F G] 4.2 If the involvement of the Chief Justice of India is necessary even for commencing the investigation into the offence, and the President while granting the sanction under section 6(1)(c) is also assumed to act on the advice of the Chief Justice of India and if it is permissible to do so in the absence of any 'such provision in the Act, the problem would arise where such action is contemplated against the Chief Justice of India himself. [297G H; 298A] 4.3 Any provision which cannot apply to the Chief Justice of 212 India, cannot apply to the Judges of the Supreme Court, or for that matter even to the High Court Judges, since the Chief Justice of India is not a vertical superior of any of them, there being no such vertical hierarchy and the Chief Justice of India having no power of superintendence even over the High Court Judges, much less the Supreme Court Judges. [298A B] 4.4 In the case of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Chief Election Commissioner, the situation would be more piquant. The Chief Justice of India cannot be involved in the process relating to them and there is none else to fill that role in that situation. The Constitution, while providing that their position would be akin to that of a Judge of the Supreme Court, could not have intended to place them on a pedestal higher than that of a Supreme Court Judge. If the Act was intended to apply to these constitu tional functionaries, it could not have been enacted leaving such gaping holes which are incapable of being plugged to present a comprehensive scheme for this purpose. [298C E] 5.1 The need for sanction under section 6 of the Act for prosecution of the holder of a public office indicates the ambit and scope of the enactment for deciding whether the holder of a public office falls within the purview of the enactment. No sanction for prosecution under section 6 is re quired after the public servant ceases to hold office, but it does not imply that every holder of a public office after ceasing to hold that office is within the purview of the enactment, even though during the tenure in office, only those public servants are within its ambit in whose case sanction under section 6 must be obtained. [298F H; 299A] 5.2 The ambit of the enactment is to be determined on the basis of the public office held by the public servant, which office is alleged to have been abused during the tenure for committing the offence of criminal misconduct under the Act and it is not the fact of continuance in that office or ceasing to hold it which decides the ambit of the enactment. If the holder of a public office during his tenure in office cannot be prosecuted without sanction under section 6, then, no sanction for his prosecution after ceasing to hold the office may be necessary, but his prosecution is made because while in office he could be prosecuted with the previous sanction under section 6. Conversely, if the holder of a public office while continuing in that office could not be prosecuted under this Act on account of inapplicability of section 6 and, therefore, the non feasibility of previous sanc tion for prosecution under section 6, then on his ceasing to hold 213 5.3 It is for the purpose of construing the provisions of the enactment and determining the scope and ambit thereof and for deciding whether the holder of a public office comes within the purview of the enactment that the feasibility of previous sanction for prosecution and applicability of section 6 of the Act is important since it holds the key which unlocks the true vistas of the enactment. [299D E] 5.4 The concept of the sanction for prosecution by a superior is so inextricably woven into the fabric of the enactment that the pattern is incomplete without it. The clear legislative intent is that the enactment applies only to those in whose case sanction of this kind is contemplated and those to whom the provision of sanction cannot squarely apply are outside its ambit. The provision for sanction is like the keystone in the march of the enactment. Remove the keystone of sanction and the arch crumbles. [299E G] R.S. Nayak vs A.R. A ntulay, , dis tinguished. 6.1 The higher judiciary was treated differently in the Constitution indicating the great care and attention be stowed in prescribing the machinery for making the appoint ments. It was expected that any deviation from the path of rectitude at that level would be a rare phenomenon and for the exceptional situation the provision of removal in ac cordance with clause (4) of Article 124 was made, the diffi culty in adopting that course being itself indicative of the rarity with which it was expected to be invoked. It appears that for a rare aberrant at that level, unless the Judge resigned when faced with such a situation, removal from office in accordance with Article 124(4) was envisaged as the only legal sanction. If this was the expectation of the framers of the Constitution and their vision of the moral fibre in the higher echelons of the judiciary in free India, there is nothing surprising in the omission to bring them within the purview of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, or absence of a similar legislation for them alone. This position continued even during the deliberations of the Santham Committee which clearly mentioned in ics Report submitted in 1964 that it has considered the judiciary outside the ambit for its deliberations. Clearly, it was expected that the higher judiciary Whose word would be final in the interpretation of all laws including the Constitu tion, will be comprised of men leading in the spirit of self sacrifice concerned more with their obligations then rights, so that there would be no occasion for any one else to sit in judgment over them. [305H; 306A D] 6.2 The fact that the Parliament did not enact any other law for 214 the investigation into allegations of corruption against a superior Judge and for his trial and punishment for that offence and rest content merely with enacting the , to provide for the procedure for remov al of a Judge under Article 124 (4) is a clear pointer in the direction that the Parliament has not as yet considered it expedient to enact any such law for the trial and punish ment on the charge of corruption of a superior Judge, except by his removal from office in the manner prescribed. The provisions of the , provide the procedure for investigation and proof of an allegation of corruption against a superior Judge and if the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 is held applicable to them, then there would be two separate procedures under these two enactments providing for investigation into the same charge. This anomaly and incongruity cannot be attributed to a conscious act of the Parliament while enacting , after the 1964 amendment in the Prevention of Corruption Act. [301D F] 7.1 The constitutional functionaries namely Judges of High Courts, Judges of the Supreme Court, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Chief Election Commissioner were never intended to fall within the ambit of the Act as ini tially enacted in 1947, when provisions similar to Articles 124(4) and (5) of the Constitution were present in the Government of India Act, 1935, nor was any such attempt made by amendment of the Prevention of Corruption Act in 1964 and the same position continues in the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. [300A B] 7.2 If there is now a felt need to provide for such a situation, the remedy lies in suitable parliamentary legis lation for the purpose preserving the independence of judi ciary free from likely executive influence while providing a proper and adequate machinery for investigation into allega tions of corruption against such constitutional function aries and for their trial and punishment after the investi gation. The remedy is not to extend the existing law and make it workable by reading into it certain guidelines for which there is no basis in it, sing the Act was not intended to apply to them. [300B C] 7.3 The test of applicability of the existing law would be the legal sanction and justiciability of the proposed guidelines without which it is unworkable in the case of such persons. In fact, the very need to read the proposed guidelines in the existing law by implication is a clear indication that the law as it exists does not apply to them. Making the law applicable with the aid of the suggested guidelines, is not in the domain of judicial craftsmanship, but a naked usurpation of legislative power in a virgin field. [300C D] 215 8.1 Laying down guidelines to be implicitly obeyed, if they find no place in the existing enactment and to bring the superior Judges within the purview of the existing law on that basis would amount to enacting a new law outside the scope of the existing law and not merely construing it by supplying the deficiencies to make it workable for achieving the object of its enactment. [273E F] S.P. Sampath Kumar vs Union of India, ; , distinguished. 8.2 In case a legislation like the Prevention of Corrup tion Act for superior Judges also is considered necessary at this point of time, the Parliament can perform its function by enacting suitable legislation, it being a virgin field of legislation. [274B] 8.3 There is no material to indicate that corruption in judiciary was a mischief to be cured when the Prevention of Corruption Act was enacted. For this reason, the desirabili ty now expressed of having such a law cannot be an aid to construction of the existing law to widen its ambit and bring these constitutional functionaries within it. [273B C] 8.4 Judicial activism can supply the deficiencies and fill gaps in an already existing structure found deficient in some ways, but it must stop sort of building a new edi fice where there is none. [273D] 8.5 If it is considered that the situation has altered requiring scrutiny of the conduct of even Judges at the highest level, and that it is a matter for the Parliament to decide, then the remedy lies in enacting suitable legisla tion for that purpose providing for safeguards to ensure independence of judiciary since the existing law does not provide for that situation. [306D E] 8.6 Any attempt to bring the Judges of the High Courts and the supreme Court within the purview of the Prevention of Corruption Act by a seemingly constructional exercise of the enactment, appears to be an exercise to fit a square peg in a round hole when the two were never intended to match.

It does not indicate that Sahas are a caste distinct from the Sunri caste, nor was it intended to exclude from Sunris those members of that caste who bore the surname Saha. [391 A, D]. Therefore, when the respondent challenged the election to the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, of the appellant who described himself as a member of the Sunri caste, on the ground that he was a member of the Saha caste group but failed to prove the allegation, it must be held that the appellant was a Sunri by caste and belonged to the Scheduled caste specified in the item, even though he bore the surname Saha.

King, a businessman, was accused of receiving a bribe of Rs. 29,500 from Mulchand Kodumal Bhatia, a complainant, in exchange for relinquishing his tenancy of a flat.\n* **The Prosecution's Case:** The prosecution alleged that King demanded a sum of Rs. 30,000 for relinquishing his tenancy and that Bhatia paid him the money.\n* **The Defense:** King argued that he was seeking a partner to manage his business and that the Rs. 29,500 was a capital investment for a share in the business and a guarantee against damage to the furniture.\n\n**The Court's Decision:**\n\n* **The Court's Interpretation of Section 19(1) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act:** The court focused on the meaning of \"relinquishment\" in Section 19(1) of the Act. The court found that the word \"relinquishment\" in this context refers to the surrender of a tenant's rights and not simply the act of giving up possession.\n* **The Court's Reasoning:**\n    * The court found that the document (Exhibit D) clearly shows an assignment of the tenancy, not a relinquishment.\n    * The court emphasized that the Act specifically prohibits the receipt of any sum or consideration as a condition for relinquishing a tenancy.\n    * The court rejected the prosecution's argument that the word \"relinquishment\" should be interpreted broadly.\n    * The court found that the language of the Act is clear and unambiguous, and that the prosecution failed to prove that King had relinquished his tenancy.\n* **The Outcome:** The court set aside the conviction and the fine imposed on King. The court also upheld the conviction of the wife for aiding and abetting.\n\n**Key Legal Concepts:**\n\n* **Section 19(1) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act:** This section prohibits the receipt of any sum or consideration as a condition for relinquishing a tenancy.\n* **\"Relinquishment\" vs. \"Assignment\":** The court distinguished between relinquishment (surrender of rights) and assignment (transfer of rights).\n* **Strict Construction of Statutes:** The court emphasized that the language of the statute must be strictly construed in favor of the accused.\n\n\n**In summary, the court found that the prosecution failed to prove that King had relinquished his tenancy, and therefore, the conviction was set aside.**",
        "reference": "Sub section (1) of sec. 19 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, LVI I of 1947, provided that \"it shall not be lawful for the tenant or any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of the tenant to claim or receive any sum or any consideration as a condition for the relinquishment of his tenancy of any premises\"; and sub sec. (2) provided that any tenant or person who in contravention of the provisions of sub sec. (1) receives any sum or consideration shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment and also with fine. A. who was a tenant of a flat, handed over vacant posses sion the flat to B on receiving \"pugree\", under a document which recited that A shall have no claim whatever over the flat and that B shall pay the rent directly to the landlord. A was convicted of an offence under sec. 19 (2). Held, that there was no \"relinquishment\" of his tenancy by A, within the meaning of sec. 19 (1) and the conviction could not be sustained. There is a clear distinction between an assignment of a tenancy on the one hand and a relinquishment or surrender on the other. In the case of an assignment, the assignor con tinues to be liable to the landlord for the performance of his obligations under the tenancy and this liability is contractual, while the assignee becomes liable by reason of privity of estate. The consent of the landlord to an as signment is not necessary, in the absence of a contract or local usage to the contrary. But in the case of relinquish ment it cannot be a unilateral transaction; it can only be in favour of the lessor by mutual agreement between them. Relinquishment of possession must be to the lessor or one who holds his interest; and surrender or relinquishment terminates the lessee 's rights and lets in the lessor. As sec. 19 of Bombay Act LVII of 1947 creates an offence and imposes a penalty of fine and imprisonment, the words of the section must be strictly construed in favour of the subject. The Court is not concerned so much with what might possibly have been intended as with what has been actually said in and by the language employed in the statute. Judgment of the Bombay High Court reversed."

The case involved a dispute between the company and its employees regarding wage revisions. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**Background:**\n\n* Tata Consulting Engineers, a consulting firm, was facing a wage dispute with its employees.\n* The employees sought a revision of their wages, including a higher dearness allowance and house rent allowance.\n* The Industrial Tribunal was tasked with resolving the dispute and revising the wage scales.\n\n**The Tribunal's Decision:**\n\n* The Tribunal decided to revise the wage scales, but not by granting individual flat increases to each employee.\n* The Tribunal considered the financial capacity of the company and the cost of living, concluding that a flat increase was appropriate for the overall wage structure.\n* The Tribunal also decided to expand the span of increments for employees based on their years of service.\n\n**The Appeal:**\n\n* Tata Consulting Engineers appealed the Tribunal's decision, arguing that the Tribunal erred in granting a flat increase to each employee and in amending the award.\n* The Union argued that the Tribunal's decision was based on a misunderstanding of the original award.\n\n**The Court's Ruling:**\n\n* The Court agreed with Tata Consulting Engineers' appeal, finding that the Tribunal's decision to amend the award was beyond its jurisdiction.\n* The Court found that the Tribunal's decision to grant a flat increase to each employee was not intended in the original award and was an error of law.\n* The Court also found that the Tribunal's amendment was an attempt to add a supplementary award beyond the original award.\n* The Court quashed the Tribunal's amendment and ordered the correction of the award.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The Court emphasized the importance of adhering to the original terms of an award and the limitations of a court's jurisdiction.\n* The Court highlighted the importance of clear and unambiguous language in legal documents.\n* The Court emphasized that consent cannot confer jurisdiction on a court.\n\n\nThis case highlights the importance of careful drafting and interpretation of legal documents and the need for courts to strictly adhere to the original terms of an award.",
        "reference": "Dismissing the appeals by special leave, the Court. ^ HELD: Per Pathak, J. (Krishna Iyer and Chinnappa Reddy, JJ. concurring) (1) Having regard to the financial capacity of M/s. Tata Consulting Engineers, the appellant, and the material on the record and the various other considerations which prevailed with the Tribunal, the granting of revised wage scales is in order. Although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter. No dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time. The cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and the dearness allowance and house rent allowances made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost. During all these years, the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits; nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant 's growing prosperity. The Charter of Demands was presented by the Union in July, 1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the State Government made a reference to the Industrial Tribunal in 1975. The several considerations which prevailed with the Tribunal giving retrospectivity to the revised pay scales and referred to by it cannot be ignored. [174C G] (2) It is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index. The Tribunal, in the present case, considered the matter and found it sufficient and in accord with justice that the wage scales should be restructured with suitable increments provided therein. It noted that dearness allowance was being granted by the appellant at 10% of the salary subject to a minimum of Rs. 50/ and house rent allowance at 30% of the basic salary. Having regard to the not inconsiderable improvement in the level of the basic wage, it observed that there would be a consequent increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance. In view of the increase so secured, the Tribunal rejected the suggestion that a slab system should be introduced in the dearness allowance or that there should be any other modification of the principle on which dearness allowance was being presently granted. It declared that the cumulative effect of an im 167 proved wage structure together with dearness allowance operating on a slab system would throw an impossible burden of about Rs. 1 crore on the financial capacity of the appellant. It was open to the Tribunal to adopt the position which it did. If the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered. The award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales, larger increments longer span of 20 years for earning increments, dearness allowance at 10% of the basic wage, besides several other benefits, have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the Tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant. It is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another. [179 E F] The Hindustan Times Ltd, New Delhi vs Their Workmen, [1964] 1 SCR 234, 247 and Bengal Chemical & Pharmaceutical Works Limited vs its Workmen; , , distinguished. (3) The jurisdiction given to the Tribunal by rule 31 of the Industrial Disputes (Bombay) Rules, 1957, is closely circumscribed. It is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award. An accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted. It must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only. It must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved. [175 A C] Per contra The order of 22nd December, 1978 is invalid so far as it amends paragraph 23 of the original award. The amendment has resulted in the Tribunal making, as it were, a supplementary award, whereby a further relief is being granted beyond that granted in the original award. The original award was completed and signed by the Tribunal, and it cannot be reopened now except for the limited purpose of Rule 31. In travelling outside and beyond the terms of the original award, the Tribunal has committed a jurisdictional error. The evidence contained in the award throughout provides incontrovertible proof that this flat increase (ad hoc) was never originally intended in the award. There was only one increase contemplated in the award, in paragraph 23 of the award and it is more than plain that the increase was the one incorporated in the revised pay scales pertaining to different categories. No second flat increase was envisaged at all. The amendment made by the Tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase, this time to each individual workmen. If, as the Tribunal has stated in the amendment order. the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen, there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest. There will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by Rs. 150/ in the case of the category of Draughtsmen and Rs. 100/ in the case of other categories. Considering the fitment of the workmen in the revised scales, it was stated in the award that workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the 168 basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale. Further the award was made on the basis that the overall financial load according to paragraph 33 of the award would be to the tune of about Rs. 5 lakhs. It was that figure which the Tribunal had in mind against the backdrop of the gross annual figures when it made the revised pay scales retrospective from 1st January, 1976. [176 D G, 177A, 178 D F] The statement, Exhibit C 51 afforded an indication merely of what the additional financial load would be if a flat increase was given to the individual workmen on the alternative basis set forth therein. None of the alternatives actually adopted by the Tribunal, because when the award was made the Tribunal proceeded instead to restructure the wage scales by the addition of Rs. 150/ in the case of the category of Draughtsmen and of Rs. 100/ in the case of other categories to the initial pay in the wage scales pertaining to these categories. The addition was integrated as a feature of the wage scales, it was not regarded as an addition to the pay of each individual workmen. [178A C] It is an accepted principle that consent by a party cannot confer jurisdiction on a court. What is without jurisdiction will remain so. [178 E F] Per O. C. Reddy, J. (Majority view, Iyer and Reddy, JJ.) The order dated December 22, 1978 of the Industrial Tribunal which purports to correct the award dated December 20, 1978 cannot be considered in effect to be a fresh award and it is in order. The omission of the words \"to each employee\" after the figure Rs. 150/ and again after the figure Rs. 100/ was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the Tribunal was entitled to correct. The application for the correction was made immediately, that is to say, two days after the Award, while iron was still hot or when everything must have been fresh to the minds of the Tribunal. Even the endorsement made on the application by the Advocate for the Company to the effect \"submitted to whatever this honourable Tribunal desires to do, does not indicate that the Company had any objection to the award being corrected as sought by the employees union. On the other hand the endorsement reads as if there was tacit agreement on the part of the Company to the correction sought by the union; it cannot possibly be doubted that an Industrial Tribunal deciding upon the wage scales of the employees of an establishment would have full liberty to propose ad hoc increase of salaries as part of the revision of pay scales, not can it be doubted that fitment into the revised pay scales is certainly a part of the revision of pay scales. This is elementary and fundamental to the jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal in revising wage scales. If without any flat or ad hoc increase of salary the workmen were to be fitted into revised scales of pay, it would, obviously, result in serious anomalous situations. In the case of several senior employees, the revised scale would yield but a very small and almost a token increase in the size of the pay packet whereas the junior employees would get a large benefit. While workmen raising industrial disputes for revision of wage scales are certainly minded about their future prospects in the matter of wages, they, surely would be more concerned with the immediate benefit accruing to them. That was why the Industrial Tribunal thought that all round flat increase of Rs. 150/ in the case of Draughtsmen and Rs. 100/ in the case of other workmen to each employee was called for. [180C, 181D E, G H, 182A, 183D E, G H, 184A B] 169 (4) While it is true that Dearness Allowance linked to cost of living index is ordinarily the best and the most scientific method of computing dearness allowance, it cannot always be said that an illegality warranting interference under Article 136 is committed if some other method is adopted. In the instant case, the Tribunal has given satisfactory reasons for adopting a different mode. [184 F G]"

        "reference": "In pursuance of an award made by an Industrial Tribunal fixing the pay of the employees at Rs. 2/2/ per day, the management of the appellant had entered into an agreement with its workmen, that the effect would be given to the wage structure prescribed by the said award. In spite of the award and the agreement, the appellant paid its employees only As. /10/ per day and that led to the present claim made by the respondents under section 15 of the Payment of Wages Act. They asked for an order from the payment of wages authority directing the appellant to pay the said prescribed wages. Against the respondent 's claim it was urged by the appellant that section 15 of the Act was inapplicable, because the rates of wages fixed by the award did not fall within the definition of wages prescribed by section 2(vi) of the Act. The authority rejected the appellant 's contention. The appellant then challenged the correctness of the conclusion of the authority before the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution. The High Court dismissed the writ petition and affirmed the finding of the authority. It held that section 15 was applicable to the case, because the wages prescribed by the award did amount to wages as defined by section 2(vi) of the Act. On appeal by Special Leave the appellant contended that before it is held that the wages prescribed by the award fall under section 2(vi), it must be shown that they constitute part of the terms of the contract of employment, either express of implied. Held: The argument is not well founded. When an award is made and it prescribes a new wage structure, in law the old contractual wage structure becomes inoperative and its place is taken by the wage structure prescribed by the award. In a sense, the latter wage structure must be deemed to be the contract between the parties, because that, in substance, is the effect of industrial adjudication. The true legal position is that when industrial disputes are decided by industrial adjudication and awards are made, the said awards supplant contractual terms in respect of matters covered by them and are substituted by them. That being so, it is difficult to hold that the wages prescribed by the award cannot be treated as wages under section 2(vi) of the Act before it was amended. The amendment has merely clarified what was included in the unamended definition itself. South Indian Bank Ltd. vs A. R. Chacko, A.I.R, 1964 S.C. 1522, referred to.

The Income tax Officer acting under the provisions of the Travancore Income tax Act, determined the assessable income representing only the profits made in Travancore State and under section 32(1), first proviso of the Travancore Income tax Act which corresponds to the first proviso to section 24(1) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922 refused to allow a deduction of the losses incurred. The assessees claimed that the business 257 which they were carrying on was one and indivisible for the purpose of determining the amount assessable to income tax and that they were entitled to a deduction of the losses incurred outside Travancore State. The contention on behalf of the income tax authorities was (i) that under the first proviso to section 32(1) of the Travancore Income tax Act losses incurred in places out I side the State of Travancore cannot be set off against profits made in that State, (2) that though profits and losses in the State arising under the same head could be set off, the proviso, aforesaid, affected not only the generality of the main enactment but also introduced an addendum that where the profits of the business arose in the State and the losses under the head business were sustained outside that State, those losses could not by virtue of the proviso be deducted from profits made in the State,(3) that the proviso applied only to the bead \" business in the two respective territories, as the words used therein are where the loss sustained is a loss of profits or gains \" andthe word \" income \" is not mentioned therein, and (4) that the word \" business \" in section 13 of the Travancore Act corresponding to section 10 of the Indian Act, must mean business in Travancore State under section 13 Of that Act and \" business in British India \" under the Indian Act, because before 1939 income was not chargeable under the two Acts, unless it was received or accrued in Travancore State or British India, as the case may be, and profits and gains of business in territories outside Travancore or in an Indian State were exempted from payment of income tax in Travancore State or in British India, as the case may be. Held:(i) Under section 24(1) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922 Is. 32(1) of the Travancore Income tax Act] a set off can be claimed only when the loss arises under one head and the income, profits and gains against which it is sought to be set off arises under a different head. In cases where profits and losses arise under the same head they have to be adjusted against each other under the provisions Of sections 7 to 12B of the Indian Act. Arunachalam Chettiar vs Commissioner of Income tax, (1936) L.R. 63 I. A. 233 and Anglo French Textiles Co., Ltd. vs Commissioner of Income tax, Madras, , relied on. (2)The territory of a proviso is to carve out an exception to the main enactment and exclude something which otherwise would have been within the section; it has to operate in the same field and if the language of the main enactment is clear it cannot be used for the purpose of interpreting the main enactment or to exclude by implication what the enactment clearly says unless the words of the proviso are such that that is its necessary effect. Abdul jabar Butt vs State of Jammu and Kashmir, ; , Ram Narain Sons Ltd. vs Assistant Commissioner of Sales ' ; , Madras & (1944) L.R. 71 I.A. 113 33 258 and Corporation of the City of Toronto vs Attorney General for Of Canada, , relied on. Consequently, section 24(1), first proviso, of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922 Is. 32(1), first proviso, of the Travancore Act] bars the right of set off only where a loss in the Indian States under one head is sought to be set off against profits in British India under any other head, and does not apply to profits and losses and computation thereof which fall under section 10 of the Indian Act, corresponding to section 13 of the Travancore Act. (3)The mere fact that the word \" income \" is not used in the proviso does not justify the construction that the intention of the Legislature was to restrict the right to a set off of profits and losses arising in Indian States only to business or to modify the mode of computation under section 10 of the Indian Income tax Act. (4)The word \" business,, in section 10 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, is not confined to business in British India, in view of the definition of \" total income \" and \" total world income \" and chargeability of total income under section 3, Or the provisions Of section 4 where in the case of a resident \" total income \" includes income, profits and gains accruing within or without British India."

        "reference": "Shortly after the extension of the age of retirement from 55 to 58 subject to the employee passing a medical examination at 55 in the respondent company 's Head Office at Calcutta, their workmen at Bombay branch raised an industrial dispute claiming the extension of their age of retirement from 55 to 60. The dispute was referred to the Industrial Tribunal. The company resisted the claim but was agreeable to introduce similar provisions as introduced at Calcutta. The difficulty in accepting the company 's case was the conclusion recorded by the Supreme Court in its earlier decisions that the trend in Bombay region was to fix the age at 60. So the Tribunal considered it to be its duty to enquire whether the conclusion recorded by the Supreme Court was accurate and ultimately persuaded itself to hold that no such trend was established in fact, and directed that the age of retirement should be 58. Held: (i) After careful consideration of all the materials placed on this record, there was nothing to justify any doubt about the correctness of what was said on the earlier occasion by this Court. The approach adopted by the Tribunal in dealing with this aspect of the problem is not very commendable and its present conclusion that what was said by itself on an earlier occasion and was confirmed by this Court in appeal, was in fact inaccurate, is on the whole unsound. What the Tribunal has failed to notice is that instances which may justify a revision of the judicial opinion expressed on an earlier occasion about a particular trend must be strong and unambiguous and they must speak for the period both before and more particularly after the previous finding had been recorded in the matter. (ii) The information furnished by the several documents on this record clearly show a consistent trend in the Bombay region to fix the retirement age of clerical and subordinate staff at 60.

The case involved an appeal against a decision by the Company Law Board to investigate the affairs of the company. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**Background:**\n\n* **Company:** Barium Chemicals Ltd. was a company formed to manufacture barium chemicals.\n* **Investigation:** The Company Law Board (CLB) investigated the company's affairs under section 237(b) of the Companies Act, 1956. This section allows the CLB to investigate a company if it believes there are circumstances suggesting the company is being run with intent to defraud creditors, members, or others, or if there is evidence of fraud, misfeasance, or other misconduct.\n* **Appeal:** The company appealed against the CLB's order, arguing that the investigation was based on extraneous and irrelevant grounds.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n* **Appellant's Argument:** The appellants argued that the CLB's order was based on subjective opinions and that the grounds for the investigation were not valid. They claimed that the CLB had acted on the instructions of the Finance Minister and that the investigation was motivated by personal animosity towards the company's Managing Director.\n* **Respondent's Argument:** The respondents argued that the CLB had a legitimate basis for its investigation, based on the company's financial performance, delays, and alleged misconduct. They claimed that the CLB had acted independently and that the investigation was necessary to protect the interests of the company's shareholders.\n\n**Key Issues:**\n\n* **Subjectivity of the CLB's Opinion:** The court had to determine whether the CLB's opinion that the company was being run with intent to defraud was based on valid grounds or was simply a subjective assessment.\n* **Extraneous Grounds:** The appellants argued that the CLB's grounds for investigation were extraneous to the matters mentioned in the section.\n* **Scope of Judicial Review:** The court had to determine the extent to which it could review the CLB's decision.\n\n**Court's Decision:**\n\n* The court found that the CLB's decision was based on a reasonable assessment of the facts and that the grounds for the investigation were not extraneous.\n* The court emphasized that the CLB's role was to investigate and not to determine the guilt or innocence of the company.\n* The court upheld the CLB's decision, finding that the investigation was necessary to protect the interests of the company's shareholders.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe court's decision in this case highlights the importance of balancing the CLB's investigative powers with the rights of the company and its shareholders. The court emphasized that the CLB's decision should be based on a reasonable assessment of the facts and that the CLB's role is to investigate, not to determine guilt.",
        "reference": "The Company Law Board was constituted under Section 10E of the , and the Central Government delegated some of its powers under the Act, including those under Section 237, to the Board. The Government also framed rules under Section 642(1) read with Section 10E(5) called the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules 1964, Rule 3 of which empowered the Chairman of the Board to distribute the business of the Board among himself and other member or members and to specify the cases or classes of cases which were to be considered jointly by the Board. On February 6, 1954, under the power vested in him by Rule 3 the Chairman passed an order specifying the cases that had to be considered jointly by himself and the only other member of the Board and distributing the remaining business between himself and the member. Under this order the business of ordering investigations under Sections 235 and 237 was allotted to himself to be performed by him singly. On May 19, 1965 an order was issued on behalf of the Company Law Board under Section 237(b) of the . appointing four inspectors to investigate the affairs of the appellant company, on the ground that the Board was of the opinion that there were circumstances suggesting that the business of the appellant company was being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members or any other persons and that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company had in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasence and other misconduct towards the company and its members. Soon afterwards the appellants filed a petition under article 226 of the Constitution for the issue of a writ quashing the order of the Board on the grounds, inter alia, that the order had been issued mala fide that there was no material on which such an order could have been made, etc. One of the affidavits filed in reply to the petition was by the ,Chairman of the Company Law Board, in which it was contended, inter alia, that there was material on the basis of which the impugned order was issued and he had himself examined this material and formed the necessary opinion within the meaning of sec. 237(b) before the issue of the order; and that it was not competent for the court to go into the question of the adequacy or otherwise of such material. In the course of replying to some of the allegations in the petition it was stated in paragraph 14 of the affidavit, however, that from memoranda received from some ex directors of the company and other examination it appeared, inter alia, that there had been delay, bungling and faulty planning of the company 's main project ,resulting in double expenditure; that the company had incurred huge losses; there had been a sharp fall in the price of the company 's SCI 22 312 shares; and some eminent persons had resigned from the Board of Directors of the company because of differences with the Managing Director on account of the manner in which the affairs of the company were being conducted. The appellant 's petition was dismissed by the High Court. In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants: (1) That the order was made made fide on account of the competing interests of a firm in which the Minister in charge of the department was interested and also because of his personal hostility against the second petitioner who was the managing director of the company; that the High Court had erred in deciding the petition on the footing that the first respondent Board was an independent authority and that it was its Chairman who on his own had formed the requisite opinion and passed the order and therefore the motive or the evil eye of the Minister was irrelevant; the High Court also erred in failing to appreciate that even though the impugned order was by the Chairman, as under section 10E(6) it had to receive and in fact received the Minister 's agreement, if the Minister 's mala fides were established, that would vitiate the order; furthermore, in the circumstances of the case. the High Court ought to have allowed the appellants an opportunity to establish their case of mala fide by the cross examination of the Minister and the Chairman, both of whom had filed affidavits. (2) That clause (b) of Section 237 required two things: (i) the requisite opinion of the Central Government, in the present case, of the Board, and (ii) the existence of circumstances suggesting that the company 's business was being conducted as laid down in sub clause (i) or that the persons mentioned in sub clause (ii) were guilty of fraud, misfeasance or misconduct towards the company or any of its members; though the opinion to be formed is subjective, the existence of circumstances set out in cl. (b) is a condition precedent to the formation of such opinion and therefore even if the impugned order were to contain a recital of the existence of those circumstances, the court can go behind that recital and determine whether they did in fact exist, that even taking the circumstances said to have been found by the respondent Board, they were extraneous to see. 237(b) and could not constitute a basis for the impugned order. (3) That the impugned order was in fact made on the basis of allegations contained in memoranda submitted by four ex directors of the company who continued to be shareholders; and by ordering an investigation under section 237(b) the respondent Board had in effect enabled these shareholders to circumvent the provisions of section 235 and section 236. On this ground also the impugned order was therefore made mala fide or was otherwise invalid. (4) That the impugned order was in any case bad as it was passed by the Chairman of the Respondent Board alone acting under rules under which such a power was conferred in contravention of the provisions of Section 10E. The power under section 237 was delegated by the Central Government to the Board as a whole and could not in turn be sub delegated to the Chairman alone in the absence of a provision such as sub sec. (4A) added to sec. 10E after the impugned order was issued, and which now enabled the solidarity of the Board to be broken. Such sub delegation could not be done in accordance with rules made under section 10E(5) which merely enabled the procedure of the Board to be regulated. 313 (5) That the impugned order was bad because Section 237(b) itself was bad as offending against articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution. HELD: (By Hidayatullah. Bachawat and Shelat, JJ., Sarkar C.J. and Mudholkar J. dissenting): The impugned order must be set aside. (1) (By the Court): The respondents had failed to show that the impugned order was passed mala fide. L330 E; 335 B C; F G]. (Per Sarkar C.J. and Mudholkar J.3: The decision to order the investigation was taken by the Chairman of the respondent Board and there was nothing to indicate that in arriving at that decision he was influenced by the Minister. If the decision arrived at by the Chairman was an independent one, it could not be said to have been rendered mala fide because it was later approved by the Minister. [320 D]. In a proceeding under article 226 of the Constitution, the normal rule is, as pointed out by this Court in The State of Bombay vs Purshottam Jog Naik ; , to decide disputed questions on the basis of affidavits and that it is within the discretion of the High Court whether to allow a person who has sworn an affidavit before it to be cross examined or not. The High Court having refused permission for the cross examination, it would not be appropriate for this Court, while hearing an appeal. by special leave, to interfere lightly with the exercise of its discretion. [320 G H; 321 A]. (Per Shelat J.): The allegations of mala fides in the petition were not grounded on any knowledge but only on \"reasons to believe\". Even for their reasons to believe, the appellants had not disclosed any information on which they were founded. No particulars of the main allegations were given. Although in a case of this kind it would be difficult for a petitioner to have personal knowledge in regard to an averment of mala fides, where such knowledge is wanting, he must disclose his source of information so that the other side gets a fair chance to verify it and make an effective answer. In the absence of tangible materials, the only answer which the respondents could array against the allegations as to mala fides would be one of general denial. [352 D H]. In a petition under article 226, there is undoubtedly ample power in the High Court to order attendance of a deponent in court for being cross examined. Where it is not possible for the court to arrive at a definite conclusion on account of there being affidavits on either side containing allegations and counter allegations, it would not only be desirable but in the interest of justice the duty also of the court to summon a deponent for cross examination in order to arrive at the truth. However, the High Court was rightly of the view that in the present case even if the two deponents were to be called for cross examination, they could in the absence of particulars of allegations of mala fides and the other circumstances of the case, only repeat their denials in the affidavits of the allegations in the petition and therefore such cross examination would not take the court any further than the affidavits. [353 D H]. (2) (Per Hidayatullah, Bachawat and Shelat JJ. Sarkar, C. J. and Mudholkar J. dissenting,):The circumstances disclosed in paragraph 14 of the affidavit must be regarded as the only materials on the basis of which the respondent Board formed the opinion before ordering an investigation under Section 237(b). These circumstances could not reasonably suggest that the business of the company was being conducted to defraud the creditors, members or other L/S5SCI 22(a) 314 persons or that the management was guilty of fraud towards the company and its members; they were therefore, extraneous to the matters mentioned in section 237(b) and the impugned order was ultra vires the Section. [339 A D, G H; 340 A; 342 G H; 343 AC; 365 D E; 367 A C]. (Per Hidayatullah J.): The power under Section 237(b) in a discretionary power and the first requirement for its exercise is the 'honest formation of an opinion that an investigation is necessary. ,The next requirement is that \"there are circumstances suggesting\" the inferences stout in the Section. An action, not based on circumstances suggesting an inference of the enumerated kind will not be valid. No doubt the formation of opinion is subjective but the existence of circumstances relevant to the inference as the sine qua non for action must be demonstrable. If their existence is questioned, it has to be proved at least prima facie. It is not sufficient to assert, that the circumstances exist and give no clue to what they are, because the circumstances must be such as to lead to conclusions of certain definiteness. The conclusions must relate to an intent to defraud, a :fraudulent or unlawful purpose, fraud or misconduct or the withholding of information of a particular kind. [335 F H; 336 G H] An examination of the affidavit filed by the Chairman of the respondent Board showed that the material examined by the Chairman merely indicated the need for a deeper probe. This was not sufficient. The material must suggest certain inferences and not the need for \"a deeper probe\". The former is a definite conclusion the 'latter a mere fishing expedition. [338 E H]. (Per Shelat J.): Althouugh the formation of opinion by cen tral Government is a purely subjective process and such an opinion cannot be challenged in a court on the ground of propriety, reasonableness or sufficiency, the Authority concerned is nevertheless required to arrive at such an opinion from circumstances suggesting what is set out in sub clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of section 237 (b). The expres sion \"circumstances suggesting\" cannot support the construction that even the existence of circumstances is a matter of subjective opinion. It is hard to contemplate that the legislature could have left to the subjective process both the formation of opinion and also the existence of circumstances on which it is to be founded. It is also not reasonable to say that the clause permitted the Authority to say that it has formed the opinion on 'circumstances which in its opinion exist and which in its opinion suggest an intent to defraud or a fraudulent or unlawful purpose. If it is shown that the circumstances do not exist or that they are such that it is impossible for any one to form an opinion therefrom suggestive of the matters enumerated in section 237 (b) the opinion is challengeable on the ground 'of non application of mind or perversity or on the ground that it was formed on collateral grounds and was beyond the scope of the statute. [362 H; 363 A G]. (Per Sarkar C.J., and Mudholkar J. dissenting): An examina tion of section 237 would show that cl. (b) thereof confers a discretion upon the 'Board to appoint an Inspector to investigate the affairs of a company. The words \"in the opinion of\" govern the word \"there are circumstances suggesting\" and not the words \"may do so\". The words 'circumstances ' and 'suggesting ' cannot be dissociated without making it impossible for the Board to form an 'opinion ' at all. The formation of an opinion must, 'therefore, be as to whether there are circumstances suggesting the existence of one or more of 'the matters in sub cls. (i) to (iii) and not about anything else. The opinion must of course not have been arrived at mala fide. To say that the, opinion to be formed must be as to the necessity 315 of making an investigation would be making a clear departure from the language in which section 237(b) is couched. It is only after the formation of certain opinion by the Board that the stage for exercising the discretion conferred by the provision is reached. The discretion conferred to order an investigation is administrative and not judicial since its exercise one way or the other does not affect the rights of a company nor does it lead to any serious consequences as, for instance, hampering the business of the company. As has been pointed out by this Court in Raja Narayanalal Bansilal vs Maneck Phiroz Mistry and Anr. , the investigation undertaken under this provision is for ascertaining facts and is thus merely exploratory. The scope for judicial review of the action of the Board must, therefore be strictly limited. If it can be shown that the Board had in fact not formed an opinion its order could be successfully challenged. There is a difference between not forming an opinion at all and forming an opinion upon grounds, which, if a court could go into that question at all, could be regarded as inapt or insufficient or irrelevant. The circumstances set out in paragraph 14 of the affidavit of the Chairman of the respondent Board were nothing more than certain conclusions drawn by the Board from some of the material which it had before it. Moreover, the expression \"inter alia\" used by the Chairman would show that the conclusions set out by him specifically were not the only ones which could be drawn from the material before the Board. It would not therefore be right to construe the affidavit to mean that the only conclusions emerging from the material before the Board were those set out in paragraph 14. [352 A E]. (3) (Per Sarkar C. J. and Mudholkar J.): As it could not be said that the investigation had been ordered either at the instance of 4 ex directors of the company or on the sole basis of the memoranda submitted by them, there was no contravention of the provisions of Sections 235 and 236 of the Act. [328 C, E]. (4) (Per Sarkar C. J., Mudholkar and Bachawat JJ. , Hidayatullah and Shelat JJ., dissenting): Rule 3 of the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules, 1964, and the order dated April 6, 1964 made pursuant thereto distributing the business of the Board, were both valid. The impugned order was not therefore invalid because it was made by the Chairman alone and not by the Board. [330 C. D; 342 B C]. (Per Sarkar C.J. and Mudholkar J.): Bearing in mind the fact that the power conferred by Section 237(b) is merely administrative, the allocation of the business of the Board relating to the exercise of such power must be regarded as a matter of procedure. Strictly speaking the Chairman to whom the business of the Board is allocated does not become a delegate of the Board at all. He acts in the name of the Board and is no more than its agent. But even if he is looked upon as a delegate of the Board and, therefore, sub delegate vis avis the Central Government, he would be as much subject to the control of the Central Government as the Board itself, for sub section (6) of section 10E provides that the Board shall, in the exercise of the powers delegated to it, be subject to the control of the Central Government and the order distributing the business was made with permission of the Central Government. Bearing in mind that the maxim delegates non protest delegable sets out what is merely a rule of construction, subdelegation can be sustained if permitted by an express provision or by necessary implication. Where, as here, what is sub delegated is an administrative power and control over its exercise is retained by the nominee of Parliament, that is, here the Central Government, the power to make a delegation may be inferred, [329 F H; 330 A C]. 316 (Per Bachwat J.): The function under section 237(b) involves the exercise of a discretion. Prima facie all the members of the Board acting together were required to discharge this function and they could not delegate their duty to the Chairman. However, under sections 10E(5) and 642(1), the Central Government may frame rules regulating the procedure of the Board and generally to carry out the purpose of the Act. In the context of section 10E, the rule making power should be construed liberally. The Central Government has power to constitute the Company Law Board, to delegate its function to the Board and to control the Board in the exercise of its delegated functions. In this background, by conferring on the Central Government the additional power of framing rules regulating the procedure of the Board and generally to carry out the purposes of section 10E Parliament must have intended that the internal Organisation of the Board and the mode and manner of transacting its business should be regulated entirely by rules framed by the Government. The Government had, therefore, power to frame the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules. 1964 authorising the Chairman to distribute the business of the Board. In the exercise of the power conferred by this rule, the Chairman assioned the business under section 237 to himself. The Chairman alone could, therefore, pass the impugned order. [341 F H; 342 A C]. (Per Hidayatullah J.): The new sub section 4A of Section 10E, which was not there when the impugned order was made. enables the work of the Board to be distributed among members, while sub section (5) merely enables the procedure of the Board to be regulated. These are two very different things. One provides for distribution of work in such a way that each constituent part of the Board, properly autho rised. becomes the Board. The other provides for the procedure of the Board. What is the Board is not a question which admits of solution by procedural rules but by the enactment of a substantive provision allowing for a different delegation. Such an enactment has been framed in relation to the Tribunal constituted under section 10B and has now been framed under section 10E also. The new sub section involves a delegation of the powers of the Central Government to a member of the Board which the Act previously allowed to be made to the Board only. The statute, as it was formerly, gave no authority to delegate if differently or to another person or persons. When it spoke of procedure in sub section (5) it spoke of the procedure of the Board As constitlited. The lacuna in the Act must have felt; otherwise there was no need to enact sub section (4A), [334 B E]. (Per Shelat T.): The statute having permitted the delegation of powers to the Board only as the statutory Authority the powers so delegated have to be exercised by the Board and not by its components. To authorise its Chairman to hand over those functions and powers to the. Board only as the statutory Authority, the powers so by the Act. The effect of r. 3 and the order of distribution of work made in pursuance thereof was not laying down a procedure but au thorising and, making a sub delegation in favour of the members. The only procedure which the Government could prescribe was the procedure in relation to Board the manner in which it should discharge and exercise the functions and Powers delegated to it, but it could not make a provision which under the cloak of procedure authorised sub delegation. [369 F H; 370 A, B]. (5) (By the Court): The provisions of Section 237(b) were not violative of Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution. [328 F G; 342 D F; 371 H]. Sections 234, 235, 236 and 237(b) gave power to different authorities i.e. the Registrar and the Government, provided powers which 317 are different in extent and nature, exercisable in sets of circumstances and in a manner different from one another. Therefore, there is no question of discriminatory power having been vested in the Government under these Sections to pick and choose between (one company and the other. [370 G, H]. When investigation is ordered, there would be inconvenience in the carrying on of the business of the company. It might also perhaps shake the credit of a company. But an investigation directed under section 237(b) is essentially of an exploratory character and it is not as if any restriction is placed on the right of the concerned company to carry on its business and no restrictions are imposed on those who carry on the company 's affairs. Even if it is regarded as a restriction, it is not possible to say that it is not protected as a reasonable restriction under Clause 6 of article 19(1). [371 B D]. Case law referred to."

Searches were conducted, and the stolen goods were found in their homes.\n\n**The Appeal:**\n\n* **The Appellant's Argument:** The appellants argued that the presumption of complicity in the dacoity should not have been drawn because the circumstances did not support it. They argued that the presumption should be based on a lesser presumption under sections 411 or 412 of the Indian Penal Code, and that the specific circumstances for drawing a higher presumption were not clearly defined.\n* **The Court's Reasoning:** The court rejected the appellants' argument. They stated that:\n    * The discovery of stolen goods in the possession of the accused strengthens the evidence against them, even if there is no direct evidence of their involvement in the crime.\n    * The time gap between the crime and the discovery of the goods is not a significant factor in this case, as the stolen goods were large quantities of cloth, and the time frame was short.\n    * The large number of people involved in the crime, the searches conducted, and the discovery of the goods in the homes of multiple individuals, all point to the possibility that the accused were the perpetrators themselves.\n    * The court found that the presumption of complicity was drawn correctly based on the circumstances.\n\n**The Verdict:**\n\n* **The Appeal:** The appeal was partly allowed. The conviction was upheld, and the sentence was reduced to three years of rigorous imprisonment. The fine was upheld.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* The court emphasized that the presumption of complicity in dacoity can be drawn when the discovery of stolen goods in the possession of an accused strengthens the evidence against them.\n* The court rejected the appellants' argument that the presumption should be based on a lesser presumption, as the circumstances in this case supported the drawing of the higher presumption.\n* The court found that the time gap between the crime and the discovery of the goods was not a significant factor in this case.\n\n\n**Overall:** The court upheld the conviction and sentence, finding that the evidence against the appellants was strong enough to support the presumption of their involvement in the dacoity.",
        "reference": "Two carts loaded with cloth returning alongwith others from a weekly village market were looted by 20 or more persons. The houses of 20 persons including the 14 appellants were searched and the looted cloth was recovered from their Possession. They were tried and held guilty Linder section 395 of the Indian Penal Code. The High Court dismissed their appeals. In appeal by special leave to this Court their only contention was that in the absence of other evidence connecting them with the dacoity, the presumption to be drawn from the possession of stolen clothes ought to have been one under section 411 of he Indian Penal Code or at the most under section 412 of the Indian Penal Code and not of complicity in the crime of dacoity. It was urged that since section 114 of the Evidence Act did not lay down definitely the presumption to be drawn in a given set of circumstances it was necessary always to start with the lesser presumption and draw the higher presumption only when there was some other evidence to. show the complicity of the persons in the crime itself. HELD : If there is other evidence to connect an accused with the crime itself, however small, the finding of the stolen property with him is a piece of evidence which connects him further with the crime. There is then no question of presumption. The evidence strengthens the other evidence already against him. It is only when the accused cannot be conis stronger than if there is a large gap of time. Disposal of the fruits of crime that the presumption may be drawn. In what circumstances the one presumption or the other may be drawn will differ from case to case [722 D] When the discovery of the fruits of crime is made immediately after the commission of the crime the presumption of complicity in the crime nected with the crime except by reason of possession of the fruits of crime requires the finding of a person ready to receive them and the 'shortness of time, the nature of the property which is disposed of, that is to say, its quality and character determine whether the person who had the goods in his possession received them from another or was himself the thief or dacoit, [722 F] In the present case the offence was committed at night by as many as 'IO persons or more. Shortly after the offence the houses of 20 persons were searched and large quantities of the stolen goods were found in their houses. It was impossible that these 20 persons were merely 'receivers of stolen property from some other 20 persons who were the decoits. It was legitimate therefore to raise the presumption in this case that the persons with whom the goods were found were the dacoits themselves. [723 A B]"

They argued that their thinner, which contains only liquid substances, should not be classified as a poison under the Act.\n\n**The Act:**\n\nThe Poisons Act, 1919, aims to regulate the importation, possession, and sale of poisons. It empowers state governments to make rules and notifications to regulate the trade of poisons. The Act originally listed specific poisons, but later allowed for the inclusion of new substances through rules.\n\n**The Issue:**\n\nThe central issue is whether Section 5 of the Act, which presumes any substance listed in a rule or notification as a poison, is constitutional. The petitioners argued that this provision gives the state governments too much power to arbitrarily declare substances as poisons, impacting their business.\n\n**The Court's Decision:**\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of the government, finding that:\n\n* **Section 5 is constitutional:** The court upheld the constitutionality of Section 5, stating that it is a reasonable exercise of the state's power to regulate the trade of poisons for public safety.\n* **The Act's purpose is to regulate dangerous substances:** The court emphasized that the Act's purpose is to control the dangerous nature of poisons and protect public health and safety.\n* **The Act allows for specific regulations:** The court acknowledged that the Act allows for specific regulations based on the local context and the need to control the sale and possession of poisons.\n* **No discrimination:** The court rejected the petitioners' argument that the Act discriminates against them. It stated that the decision to declare a substance as a poison is based on the specific circumstances and needs of each area.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* The court recognized the inherent danger of poisons and the need for regulation to protect public health.\n* The court upheld the government's power to regulate the trade of poisons based on the Act's purpose and the need to protect public safety.\n* The court emphasized that the Act allows for specific regulations based on local circumstances and the need to control the sale and possession of poisons.\n* The court rejected the petitioners' argument that the Act discriminates against them, stating that the decision to declare a substance as a poison is based on the specific circumstances and needs of each area.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe court dismissed the petition, finding that the provisions of the Act are constitutional and that the government has the power to regulate the trade of poisons for the benefit of public safety.",

(G) dated 7.8.1973 by including to the list of substances in cluded in the Rules as \"Poisons\", the substance commonly known as \"thinner\" containing spirit and other soluble material. The petitioners in this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution questioned the constitutional validity of Section 5 of the on the grounds that the section gives an arbitrary power to the State Government to include any substance as poison for the purpose of restric tion to be imposed on the possession for sale and sale of the same; that the restriction imposed on possession for sale and sale were not reasonable restrictions; that though the Act was a Central enactment, it was possible of unjust and unjustified discriminatory application as it was left to each State Government to determine what substance they would include as poison, and that the substance, 'thinner ', manu factured by the petitioners would not come within the amend ed Rules. Dismissing the petition, this Court, HELD: 1. The object of the enactment is to regulate the possession for sale and the sale, whether wholesale or retail of poisons and the importation of the same. In other words, it is intended to control over the traffic in poi sons. The enabled State Government to declare any substance as poison for the purposes of the Act by a notification under the Act or the rules made under the Act. [221 G] 3. It is not all poisonous substances that are brought within the regulation under the Act. It is those substances which the Government consider its possession for sale or sale to be regulated in the interest of health and safety of the society. This limitation is inherent in the scheme of the Act itself. [223 C D] 4. No comprehensive definition can be given to the word, \"poison\". Under this term would fall anything calculated to destroy life. Substances harmless in themselves might become poison by the time or manner of their administration. Noth ing is a poison unless regard be had to its administration. A substance may be a deadly poison or a valuable medicine according to how and how much is taken. If the resultant effect of administering into the system produces a violent, morbid or fatal changes or which destroys living tissues, the substance can be safely called poison. Any substance which is used for purposes mentioned therein section 4 can definitely be declared as poison. [223 D F] 5. It has become a notorious fact that the substance known as 'thinner ' as it is or mixing with some other sub stances are taken as intoxicating spirits endangering the life. In many cases deaths have also occurred due to, drink ing such substance. If the Government thought in the circum stances that the possession or sale of the same is to be regulated it could not be said that they have no power to regulate. Section 2 also enables the Government to regulate the possession for sale and the sale of the specified poi son. [223 G H; 224 A] 6. The nature of trade in poison is such that nobody can be considered to have an absolute right to carry on the same. It is a business which can be termed even as inherent ly dangerous to health and safety of society in view of the rampant misuse and sale to the poor, weak and helpless as an intoxicant. A law in such circumstance can regulate the trade. It is also not necessary that the same substance should be declared as poison for the entire country. The notification and its application to any area would depend on the necessity to declare the substance as poison on the particular facts and situation prevailing in that area and the need to 221 regulate the possession and sale in that area. No question of discrimination can arise in such circumstances. [224 G H; 225 A]"

The Bank claimed that under clause (ii) of para 5.356 of the Desai Award, the adjusted basic pay in,the new scale was not to exceed what point to point adjustment would give an employee on January 1, 1962 and that this being the maximum permissible under cl. (ii), cl. (iv) could not give an employee more than the maximum arrived at under cl. (ii). The employees on the other hand claimed that they were entitled to what was provided by sub cls. (a), (b) and (c) of cl. (iv) and the two increments under sub cl. (d) and that it did not matter whether what was thus arrived at exceeded the maximum provided under cl. The Labour Court partially accepted the employees ' contention and fixed their pay accordingly. In appeal. HELD:The decision of this Court in Prakash Chand Mehra 's case would govern the interpretation of para 5.356 of the Desai Award also, which is in substance the same as para 292 of the Sastry Award as modified by the Labour Appellate decision. The adjusted basic pay in cl. (ii) has to be taken as on January 1, 1959. This follows from the fact that the workman basic pay as on January 1, 1959 cannot be reduced and therefore when cl. (ii) speaks of adjusted basic pay it must refer to the same date as in cl. Further cl (iv) which provides for actual calculations starts with words \"subject to rules (i) to (iii)\" and therefore the actual calculations made under cl. (iv) must be subject to cls. (i) and (ii). This means in effect that the actual fixation under sub cls. (a), (b) and (c) of cl. (iv) will be subject to cl. (i) and cl. Under sub cl. (a) of cl. (iv) a workman will be placed in the Sastry Award as modified by placing him at the stage in the Sastry Award scale equal to or next above his basic pay as on January 1, 1959 in the scale then in force in the bank concerned. But in view of cl. (i) this cannot be less than the actual basic pay of the workman as on January 1, 1959. Where under cl. (i) the actual basic pay as on January 1, 1959 is more than what point to point adjustment will give under cl. (ii), it cannot be reduced for cl. (ii) is subject to cl. After this has been done the workman would be entitled to increments as provided in sub cl. (b) read with sub cl. (c) of cl. (iv), but this will be subject to cl. (i) and (ii) and the adjusted basic pay arrived at by giving the increments under sub cls. (b) and (c) cannot exceed the adjusted basic pay as arrived at by point to point adjustment in the Sastry Award as modified or the maximum of that scale or the 899 actual basic pay as on 1st January 1959, as the case may be. Thus sub cl. (a) is subject to cl. (i) and the basic pay to be fixed on January 1, 1959 hag to be fixed by reading sub cl. (a) of cl. (iv) and cl. (i) together. Then increments under sub cl. (b) read with sub cl. (c) of cl. (iv) have to be added, but this is again subject to the provisions of cls. (i) and (ii). [903 E; 903 G 904 E] Once it is held that basic pay under cl. (ii) has to be worked out as on January 1, 1959 the two increments provided by sub cl. (d) of cl. (iv) which are beyond that date must be given over and above what has been worked out under sub cls. (a), (b) and (c) of cl. (iv) of the Desai Award. The fact that by oversight sub cl. (d) of cl. (iv) was not made a separate clause would make no difference for sub cl.

Thereafter, 225 the Chief Minister along with the Minister of Tourism and the Minister for Metropolitan Development visited the site accompanied by the Director of the Zoo to apparently knew about the proposal right from the start. A note was then prepared by the Secretary, Metropolitan Development Depart ment and put up to the Chief Minister for his approval. The Chief Minister approved the proposal and required it to be placed before the Cabinet. On January 7, 1981 a memorandum was prepared for the consideration of the Cabinet explaining the need for the more Five Star Hotels in Calcutta and the benefits flowing out of the construction and establishment of such Five Star Hotels and suggesting the lease of Hast ings House Property to the I.T.D.C. Group and the Begumbari property to the Taj Group of Hotels. In regard to the Begum bari property, it was stated: \"From the property of the Zoological Gardens on the Belvedere Road it is possible to carve out about four acres of land currently used for dump ing garbage and also for growing grass for the elephants. It will be necessary and in any case advisable to shift the dumping ground. While adequate space can be made available for growing grass elsewhere in the same area. \" It was stated that the Finance and Tourism Departments had agreed to the proposal to lease the properties to the I.T.D.C. and the Taj Group respectively. It was stated that though the Forest Department had suggested that Salt Lake was a better place for establishing a Five Star Hotel, there was no demand for a Five Star Hotel in that area and the request for a hotel in Salt Lake was confined to a Three Star Hotel. Cabinet approval was sought for the offers to be made to the I.T.D.C. and to the Taj Group and for the constitution of a suitable Committee to undertake negotiations with the two groups. On February 12, 1981, the Cabinet took a decision ap proving the proposal contained in the last paragraph of the Cabinet Memorandum, thus clearing the way for negotiations with the Taj Group. Meanwhile the Public Undertakings Committee appointed by the West Bengal Legislative Assembly submitted a report on 14.2. 1981 about the Zoo. While suggesting that the govern ment may consider abandoning the proposal to set up a hotel on the eastern side of the zoo, the Committee also referred to a proposal to establish a \"Subsidiary Zoo\" some slight distance from Calcutta and the request said to have been made for the allotment of 200 acres of land for that pur pose. The Chief Town Planner who visited the site at the request of the Secretary, Metropolitan Development Depart ment and in the presence of the Director of the Zoo, sug gested that 2 to 2 1/2 acres of land might be 226 made available for the Hotel. On March 19, 1981 the Taj Group submitted a proposal to the government containing fairly detailed information about the tourism industry and its needs, the situation in Calcut ta, the realities of Hotel construction the facts relating to what had been done in other cities, the benefits i]owing out of the construction of hotels and their own proposals for constructing a hotel in the four acres of land in Belve dere Road. Two alternative financial arrangements were suggested. The first alternative was the payment of annual rent on the basis of the valuation of the land, the second alternative was based on the concept of nett sales, nett sales being defined as sales after deducting all taxes and levies and service charges. The Metropolitan Development Department expressed a preference for the second alternative and suggested the constitution of a Committee. The Finance Department also approved. The Taj Group was invited to send the financial projection on the basis of the second alterna tive. Correspondence went on. On June 5, 1981 a Committee of Secretaries was formally constituted. In the meanwhile WEBCON, a West Bengal Government Consultancy Undertaking, was asked to examine the proposals and to advise the Govern ment. On June 11, 1981, the Managing Committee of the Zoo passed a resolution expressing itself against the proposal to construct a hotel on land belonging to the Zoo. Accepting the note put up by the Secretary Metropolitan Development Department on the said resolution the Chief Minister minuted that \"if further facilities are necessary for the zoo, the government will provide for them.\" On June 25, 1981, the Managing Committee met again and passed another resolution by which they withdrew their earlier objections dated 11.6.1981. On June 29, 1981, the Director of the Zoo, who was a party to all the proceedings etc. right from the beginning wrote to the Secretary of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department stating his objections to the proposal to lease the land for construction of a hotel. On July 14, 1981, the WEBCON submitted its report and on the request of the Committee of Secretaries a further report was submitted on July 22, 1981. The report of WEBCON is a comprehensive report on various topics connected with the establishment of a Five Star Hotel in Calcutta. Among other things the report also suggested various financial alterna tives and recommended the second alternative based on nett sales as the best. 227 Meanwhile negotiations with Taj Group proceeded apace. The WEBCON submitted further reports. Taj Group suggested further modifications. On September 9, 1981 a detailed memorandum was prepared for cabinet discussion. Two alterna tive financial proposals were set out. A reference was made to the Committee of Secretaries who negotiated with the Taj Group of Hotels. Note was taken of the suggestion of the Negotiation Committee that the overall development plan for the environmental beautification, widening of approach roads, landscaping of Tolley 's Nullah were responsibilities of the State Government and estimated to cost Rs.2 crores but that it was expected to be of considerable public bene fit. Stress was laid on the direct and indirect economic activities which would be generated by the establishment of a five Star Hotel. Reference was also made to the report of WEBCON and it was noted that the projected profitability of the venture to the government was expected to be high. It was also mentioned that the Ministers, incharge of Tourism, Animal Husbandry, Land Revenue and Finance had seen the note and had agreed to it. On September 10, 1981 the Cabinet took the final decision to grant a ninety nine years lease of the four acres of Begumbari land to the Taj Group of Hotels. On September 29, 1981 the Government of West Bengal officially conveyed its acceptance of the proposal of the Taj Group of Hotels for the construction of a Five Star Hotel. The terms and conditions of the lease were set out. On January 7. 1982, there was a joint meeting of the Establishment and Finance sub Committees of the Zoo and it was decided to recommend to the Committee of management that the demarcated area of four acres may be relinquished in favour of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department subject to the requirement that the zoo will continue to get the services and the facilities in the existing structures until they were reconstructed on the adjacent land. On January 11, 1982 the Managing Committee endorsed the view of the sub commit tees and this was communicated to the government. On January 15, 1982, the Government of West Bengal wrote to the Land Acquisition Officer, with copies to the Taj Group of Hotels directing the Land Acquisition Officer to give possession of the land to the Taj Group of Hotels subject to their later executing a proper long term lease. It was mentioned in the letter that the construction of the Hotel should not be started till the lease deed was executed and registered. Several other stipulations were also made. Though the stipu lation was that the cost of the new construction was to be initially met by Taj Group of Hotels and later to be adjust ed against the rent payable by Taj Group, the Taj Group later agreed to waive such reimbursement (in fact a total sum of Rs.30 lakhs has been spent by Taj Group of Hotels in connections with the reconstruction. Not only this. land in the extent of 288 square 228 meters out of the plot given to them was carved out and given hack for accommodating part of the reconstructed structures. Pursuant to the letter dated January 15, 1982 possession was given to Taj Group on January 16, 1982. Thereafter an expert committee was constituted to supervise the construc tion of alternative facilities. Five petitioners a Trade Unionist, two life members of the Zoo, two other bonafide residents of Greater Calcutta, all lovers of wild life filed a petition in public interest on 26.2.1982. Initially the relief sought was primarily to restrain the Zoo authorities from giving effect to the two Resolutions dated January 7, 1982 and January 17, 1982 to hand over the four acres to the Animal Husbandry Department of the Government. Subsequent to the filing of the writ petition a lease deed was executed by the Taj Group of Hotels in favour of the government. The Writ Petition was therefore amended and a prayer for cancellation was added. While the writ petition was pending in the High Court, Late Smt. Indira Gandhi wrote a letter to Sri Jyothi Basu, the Chief Minister of West Bengal expressing the hope that he would not allow the Calcutta Zoo to suffer in any manner and would leave it intact. The Chief Minister in his reply letter dated 21.8.82 pointed out that:(i) the four acres of land were agreed to be relinquished by the Committee of management of the Zoological Garden on condition that alter native arrangement were made for shifting the existing structures which were necessary for the Zoo from the plot in question to the adjacent plot; (ii) the plot in question was not a part of the Zoo Garden; (iii) till the existing struc tures are relocated on the adjacent land, the zoo would continue to get their services and facilities from the existing structures. (iv) the hotel was not the only tall building since there existed many such residential buildings to which none raised an objection and that P&T Department are also constructing one such tall building; and (v) the lessee and their experts on wild life had assured them that in any case adequate precaution would be taken in regard to illumination of the hotel and the layout of the surrounding so that no disturbance would be caused to the flight path of the birds or animals. To similar effect was .the letter dated 30.8.1982 from Shri J.R.D. Tata to the Prime Minister on September 1, 1982. Indira Gandhi wrote to Mr. Tata expressing her happiness that the hotel was not going to upset the Zoo animals and welcoming his offer to help the State Government to improve the Zoo 's facilities. 229 A learned Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the writ petition holding that the West Bengal Government did not show any lack of awareness of the problem of environment ecology in granting the lease of land. On appeal, a Division Bench confirmed the said judgment. Hence the appeal by Special leave of the Court. Dismissing the appeal, the Court, HELD: (Per Chinnappa Reddy J.) 1.1 Whenever a problem of ecology is brought before the Court, the Court is bound to bear in mind article 48 A of the Constitution the Directive Principle which enjoins that \"The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wild life of the country, \"and article 51A(g) Which proclaims it to be the fundamental duty of every citizen of India \"to protect and improve the natural environment in cluding forest, lakes, rivers and wild life, and to have compassion for living creatures. \" When the Court is called upon to give effect to the Directive Principle and the fundamental duty, the Court is not to shrug its shoulders and say that priorities are a matter of policy and so it is matter for the policy making authority. The least that the court may do is to examine whether appropriate considera tions are borne in mind irrelevancies excluded. In appropri ate cases, the Court may go further, but how much further must depend on the circumstances of the case. The court may always give necessary directions. However the Court will not attempt to nicely balance relevant considerations When the question involves the nice balancing of relevant considera tions, the court may feel justified in resigning itself to acceptance of the decision of the concerned authority. If the Government is alive to the various considerations re quiring thought and deliberation and has arrived at a con scious decision after taking them into account, it may not be for the court to interfere in the absence of mala fides. On the other hand, if relevant considerations are not borne in mind and irrelevant considerations influence the deci sion, the Court may interfere in order to prevent a likeli hood of prejudice to the public. [242B F] 1.2 Applying the above guidelines to be followed when questions of ecology and environment are raised, it is clear that the facts and circumstances brought out by the appel lants do not justify an inference that the construction of the proposed hotel in the Begumbari land would interfere in any manner with the animals in the Zoo and the birds arriv ing at the zoo or otherwise disturb the ecology. The pro posed hotel is a Garden hotel and there is perhaps every chance of the ecology and environment improving as a result of planting numerous trees all 230 around the proposed hotel and the removal of the burial ground and dumping ground for rubbish. [263A B] 1.3 That the question of obstruction which may be caused to migratory birds did not go unnoticed by the government before the decision to lease the land was taken, is clear from the following: (i) the question of the migratory bird was first raised in the resolution of the Managing Committee dated June 11, 1981. This resolution was forwarded to the Chief Minister and considered by him as evident from the note of the Chief Minister and the subsequent reversal of the Managing Committee 's resolution at the instance of the Chief Minister and on his assurance; (ii) that the govern ment was aware of the dissension based on the alleged ob struction likely to be caused by a multi storeyed building to the flight of the migratory birds appears from the letter of the Chief Minister to the Prime Minister. In this letter, the Chief Minister pointed out that there were already in existence a number of multistoreyed buildings all around the Zoological Garden, but there was no report that they had any adverse effect on the migratory birds or the animals. He also pointed out that all precautions would be taken in the matter of illumination of the hotel and lay out of the surroundings so that no disturbance would be caused to the flight path of the birds or animals; (iii) Shri J.R.D. Tata, on behalf of the Taj Group of Hotels also wrote to the Prime Minister assuring her that the hotel management had dis cussed the matter at length with a representative of the Wild Life Fund who, after discussion had been satisfied that the proposed hotel would cause no disturbance to the birds. He further assured her that he had himself gone thoroughly in to the project with the special reference to the possible impact on the birds and the environment and had satisfied himself that project would not cause any disturbance to the birds or their free movement. He pointed out that the four acre plot was not within the main Zoological Garden, but was separated from it by the Belvedere Road which was an impor tant thoroughfare in the city. It was about 700 feet from the main part of the lake. The hotel was proposed to be built away from the frontage of the plot in Belvedere Road and was to be a low rise structure, the highest point of which would not exceed 75 feet, far below the trajectory of the birds. He mentioned that Dr. Biswas a renowned ornithol ogist had also been consulted by the Taj Management and he had also confirmed that a 75 feet building would not inter fere with the landing or climbing out of the birds from the lake. He further mentioned that the grounds of the Zoo between the lake and the Belvedere Road were covered with tail trees and that the birds negotiating the trees would have to fly at a steeper angle than it would be necessary to negotiate the proposed hotel. The vehicu 231 lar traffic on Belvedere Road which was also heavy did not bother the birds and the slight increase of the vehicular traffic consequent on the construction of the hotel was also not likely to bother them either. It was also pointed out that particular care would be taken in the matter of illumi nation of the hotel so that bright lights or neon signs emanating from the hotel would not disturb the birds and animals. In the circumstances, the government was alive to the ecological considerations particularly the question of the migratory birds. [260E H; 261A E] 2.1 It is wrong to think that every thing not mentioned in the Cabinet Memoranda did not receive consideration by the government. In the instant case the process of choosing and allotting the land to the Taj Group of Hotels nearly took two years during the course of which objections of various kinds were raised from time to time. It was not necessary that everyone of these objections should have been mentioned and considered in each of the Cabinet Memoranda. [260C E] 2.2 The proposition that a decision must be arrived at after taking into account all relevant considerations, eschewing all irrelevant considerations cannot for a moment be doubted. In the instant case, relevant considerations were not ignored and indeed were taken into consideration by the Government of West Bengal. It is not one of those cases where the evidence is first gathered and a decision is later arrived at one flue morning and the decision is incorporated in a reasoned order. This is a case where discussion had necessarily to stretch over a long period of time. Several factors have to be independently and separately weighed and considered. This is a case where the decision and the rea sons for the decision could only be gathered by looking at the entire course of events and circumstances stretching over the period from the initiation of the proposal to the taking of the final decision. The argument that what was not said in either of the Cabinet Memoranda could not later be supplemented by considerations which were never present in the mind of the decision making authority is not correct. [263E G] Rohtas Industries Ltd. vs S.D. Agarwal, ; and Barium Chemicals vs A.G. Rana, ; , re ferred to. Mohinder Singh Gill vs Central Election Commission, , distinguished. There was no failure to observe the principles of Natural Justice. Such as those as were really interested in the matter like the Managing Committee of the Zoological Garden and the Director of the 232 Zoo did have their say in the matter. The Public Undertak ings Committee in its report discussed the matter and invit ed the Government 's attention to various factors. The matter was further discussed on the floor of the Legislative Assem bly. [264B D] 4.1 The two letters dated 23.4. 1880 and 7.7. 1880, pertaining to the grant relating to the transfer of land to the east of Belvedere Road, known as Begumbari land in 1880, produced from old official records, are public documents within the meaning of the Evidence Act. No objection either to the authenticity or to the admissibility of the documents was taken either before the Single Judge or before the Division Bench. The Managing Committee of the Zoological Garden never doubted the authenticity of the documents, nor was any question even raised to suggest that the terms of the grant were other than those mentioned in the letters. [265C E] 4.2 The new plea relating to authenticity or admissibil ity of evidence cannot be accepted in an appeal under article 136 of the Constitution. The land which was undoubtedly government land was given to the Zoological Garden upon the terms set out in the two letters. One of the terms was that the land should be restored to the government whenever required. Another terms was that the Zoological Garden Committee would be suitably compensated for any expenditure incurred by it on the construction of any building on the land. [265E] 5.1 It is true that the Act of the legislature cannot be undone by a mere act of the Executive. This is not a case where the statute vests land in the Committee and the Execu tive takes it away by its fiat. The Begumbari land was government land transferred to the charge of the Zoological Garden Committee in 1880 in accordance with the conditions and terms agreed to by the Committee in their letter dated 23.4.1880; namely; \"(i) that the land is to be used for the purpose of acclimatization only; (ii) that Carnivors are not to be kept on any part of it, on any account; (iii) that the grounds are to be kept clear and neat; (iv) that the land must be restored to the government if hereafter required. The Zoological Garden Committee being reimbursed for any expenditure they may have incurred in building there. \" Therefore, this is a case of resumption of Government land under the terms of Agreement. [264E H; 265A B] 5.2 From the Preamble and the provisions of the Bengal Public Parks Act, 1904, it is clear that the Act is intended to protect the inmates and the property of the park from injury by persons resorting 233 to the park from molestations or annoyance by others. The Act is aimed at protecting the part and its visitors from injury and annoyance by despoilers and marauders. The Act has nothing whatever to do with the vesting of any property in the parks. There is in fact no provision which deal with the vesting of property in a park, Section 3 enables the State Government to extend by a notification, the boundaries of a park but that can only be for the purposes of the Act and not for the purpose of vesting or creating any title in a property. If a piece of adjacent land, for example, is taken on lease for a specified number of years by the park and included in the park by a notification under s.3 it does not mean that the various things, the doing of which is regulated or prohibited by the Act and the rule will not be done or will be regulated on the adjacent land also. The provisions of the Bengal Public Parks Act have no relevance to the question of the power of the government to transfer the Begumbari land to the Taj Group of Hotels. [266C F] 6.1 Statutes and statutory orders have no doubt to be obeyed. It does not mean that other orders, instructions, etc. may be departed from in an individual case, if applica ble to the facts. They are not to be ignored until amended. The government or the Borad may have the power to amend these orders and instructions, but nonetheless they must be obeyed so long as they are in force and are applicable. But, from the perusal of the provisions of paragraphs 165 to 167 of the West Bengal Land Management Manual, it is clear that these provisions of the Land Management Manual do not appear to have anything to do with the transfer and use of the land in the manner proposed, in which the State also have a vital stake apart from the mere raising of revenue for the State. Paragraphs 165, 166 and 167 deal with simple cases of crea tion of non agricultural tenancies by way of long term leases. They generally deal with land which is at the dis posal of the government as waste or surplus land and are intended to secure the best revenue for the State. They do not deal with cases of transfer of land for a specific socio economic object, where, the securing of immediate revenue. is not the principal object but other social and economic benefits are sought. [267E H] 6.2 The following propositions may be taken as well established on a considerations of the earlier decisions of the Supreme Court. State owned or public owned property is not to be dealt with at the absolute discretion of he execu tive. Certain precepts and principles have to be observed. Public interest is the paramount consideration. One of the methods of securing the public interest, when it is consid ered necessary to dispose of a property, is to sell the property by public auction or by inviting tenders. Though that is the ordinary rule. it is not an invariable 234 rule. There may be situations where there are compelling reasons necessitating departure from the rule, but then the reasons for the departure must be rational and should not be suggestive of discrimination. Appearance of public justice is as important as doing justice. Nothing should be done which gives an appearance of bias, jobbery or nepotism. [273D F] 6.3 Applying the above tests, it cannot be held that the government of West Bengal did not act with probity in not inviting tenders or in not holding a public auction but negotiating straight away at arm 's length with the Taj Group of Hotels, in its pursuit or socio economic objective of encouraging tourism and earning more foreign exchange. In the present case no one has come forward alleging that he has been discriminated against and his fundamental right to carry on business had been affected. The very nature of the construction and establishment of a Five Star Hotel is indicative of a requirement of expertise and sound financial position on the part of those who might offer to construct and establish them. The decision taken by the All India Tourism Council was an open decision well known to everyone in the hotel business. Yet no one except the I.T.D.C. and the Taj Group of Hotels had come forward with any proposal. The Oberoi Group of Hotels already had a Five Star Hotel in Calcutta while the Welcome Group of Hotels were making their own Private negotiations and arrangements for establishing a Five Star Hotel. In the circumstances, particularly in the absence of any leading hotliers coming forward, the govern ment of West Bengal was perfectly justified in entering into negotiation with the I.T.D.C. and the Taj Group of Hotels instead of inviting tenders. Negotiations with those who had come forward with proposals to construct Five Star Hotels was without doubt the most reasonable and rational way of proceeding in the matter rather than inviting tenders or holding public auction. There was nothing discriminatory in the procedure adopted since no other leading hotlier had shown any inclination to come forward. Tenders and auction were most impractical in the circumstances. The choice of the Taj Group of Hotels must therefore be held to be beyond suspicion and above reproach. [273F; 268D F] Rash Bihari Panda vs State of Orissa, ; R.B. Shetry vs International Airport Authority, 14; Kasturi Lal Laxmi Reddy vs State of Jammu & Kashmir, ; ; State of Haryana vs Jaga Ram, ; Ram and Shvam Co. vs State of Haryana, ; and Chenchu Rami Redav vs Go/vt. of Andhra Pradesh, [1986] 3 SCC 391, discussed. 7.1 On a consideration of all the facts and circumstances of the 235 case, it is clear, that the government of West Bengal acted perfectly bonafide in granting the lease of Begumbari land to the Taj Group of Hotels for the construction of a Five Star Hotel in Calcutta. The government of West Bengal did not fail to take into account any relevant consideration. Its action was not against the interest of the Zoological Garden or not in the best interests of the animal inmates of the zoo or migrant birds visiting the zoo. The financial interests of the State were in no way sacrificed either by not inviting tenders or holding a public auction or by adopting the ' 'nett sales\" method. [274C E] 7.2 The \"nett sales\" method appears to be fairly well known method adopted in similar situations. This what was recommended by WEBCON, the consulting agency of the West Bengal Government which submitted a detailed report on the subject. This was also the recommendation of the Committee of Secretaries who went into the matter in death, even to lay persons who are no financial experts, it appears that the \"nett sales\" method does and the rent based on market value method does not take into account the appreciating value of land, the inflationary tendency of the prices and the profit orientation. Even on a prima a facie view, there appears to be nothing wrong. or objectionable in the \"nett sales\" method. It is profit oriented and appears to be in the best interests of the Government of West Bengal. [274A C] Per Kahlid J. (concurring) 1. Today public spirited litigants rush to courts to file cases in profusion under attractive name Public Inter est Litigation. They must inspire confidence in courts and amongst the public. They must be above suspicions. Public Interest Litigation has now come to stay. Bue one is led to think that it poses a threat to courts and public alike. Such cases are now filed without any rhyme or reason. It is, therefore, necessary to lay down clear guide lines and to outline the correct parameters for entertainment of such petitions. If courts do not restrict the free flow of such cases in the name of Public Interest Litigations, the tradi tional litigation will suffer and the courts of law, instead of dispensing justice, will have to take upon themselves administrative and executive functions. This does not mean that traditional litigation should stay put. They have to be tackled by other effective methods, like decentralising the judicial system and entrusting majority of traditional litigation to village courts and Lok Adalats without the usual populist stance and by a complete restructuring of the procedural law which is the villain in delaying disposal of cases. It is only when courts are apprised of gross viola tion of fundamental rights by a group or a class action or when 236 basic human rights are invaded or when there are complaints of such acts as shock the judicial conscience that the courts, especially this Court, should leave aside procedural shackles and hear such petitions and extend its jurisdiction under all available provisions for remedying the hardships and miseries of the needy, the under dog and the neglected. Extending help when help is required does not mean that the doors of the Supreme Court are always open to anyone to walk in. It is necessary to have some self imposed restrained on public interest litigants, so that this salutary type of litigation does not lose its credibility. [275C; 279A F] 2. The approach of the Taj Group Hotels in this case has been creditably fair. They have given all the assurances necessary to preserve the Zoo and its inmates. They were willing to afford all the requisite safeguards. In the place of a dilapidated hospital, operation theater and the like, they constructed buildings, a new at a cost of Rs. 30 lakhs which amount they were entitled to be reimbursed under cl. 25 of the lease, which they voluntarily gave up. In addition to this, they surrendered an area of 288 sq. metrs. from the land allotted to them to the Zoo. They agreed to build not the usual sky scrapper hotel, but a garden hotel, the height of which would not go beyond 75 feet, despite the fact that there existed in the surroundings area buildings which were very high. This was done to keep free the route of the flight of the birds. They agreed to have subdued light in the hotel, again in the ineterest of the birds. They also agreed to keep the surroundings of the hotel and the flora well maintained and already 30,000 plants were getting ready to adjourn the area to be occupied by them. [277H; 278A C] 3.1 Regarding the commercial and financial aspects of the lease also, there is nothing secretive. The method adopted is the nett sales method of calculating the compen sation paid, which is a well known method adopted in such situations like the one, here namely lease of land by the Government. [278C E] 3.2 A deal like the one is given cannot be concluded by public auction as it is not a case of sale of a government property. Being not a sale but a lease of land by the gov ernment public auction has necessarily to be ruled out. Only Taj Group of Hotels came forward with an offer to start the hotel. The lease was the culmination after a long, elaborate and open procedure with nothing to hide which therefore cannot justifiably be subject to adverse criticism. [278G H]"

The case concerns the validity of gifts made by Dr. Gupta to his sons and grand sons in 1957. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**Background:**\n\n* **Dr. R.S. Gupta** was a wealthy individual who made gifts to his sons and grand sons in 1957.\n* The gifts were made through book entries in the accounts of his company, Tika Ram & Sons Pvt. Ltd.\n* The Revenue Department challenged the validity of these gifts, arguing that they were not valid gifts because the company did not have sufficient cash on hand to make the gifts.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n\n* **Definition of a Gift:** The document examines the legal definition of a gift under Indian law, specifically focusing on the requirements for a valid gift under Section 122 of the Income Tax Act.\n* **Book Entries vs. Actual Delivery:** The document analyzes the legal principles surrounding the validity of gifts based on book entries versus actual delivery of the property. \n* **Overdraft Facilities:** The document explores the role of overdraft facilities in determining the validity of gifts, particularly in cases where the donor has a banking relationship with the recipient.\n* **Acceptance of Gifts:** The document examines the importance of acceptance of the gift by the donee (the recipient of the gift) and whether it is necessary for a valid gift.\n\n**Court's Decision:**\n\n* The Allahabad High Court, in its judgment, found that the gifts made by Dr. Gupta were valid. \n* The Court rejected the Revenue Department's argument that the gifts were not valid because the company did not have sufficient cash on hand.\n* The Court emphasized that the mere book entries in the company's accounts could constitute a valid gift if the donor had the intention to make the gift and the recipient accepted it.\n\n**Key Legal Precedents:**\n\n* The document cites several previous judgments from various High Courts in India, including the Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Punjab & Haryana, Rajasthan, and Delhi High Courts. \n* These judgments provide a comprehensive overview of the legal principles surrounding the validity of gifts, particularly in the context of book entries and the role of overdraft facilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe document concludes that the Allahabad High Court's decision was correct. The Court found that the book entries in Dr. Gupta's company's accounts constituted valid gifts, even though the company did not have sufficient cash on hand at the time of the gifts. \n\n\n**Important Note:** This summary is for informational purposes only and should not be considered legal advice.

        "reference": "The Income Tax Officer included in the net wealth of the respondent assessee for the assessement year 1957 58, two sums, viz., Rs. 1,50,000 and Rs.67,560/12/ which the asses see claimed to have gifted. It is stated that on January 1, 1957 the respondent assessee, by a letter directed a company in which he maintained an account, to debit his account to the extent of Rs. 1,50,000 and credit in the names of his two sons and grandsons various sums, as he had decided to give away these amounts to them out of love and affection. The company carried out the instructions and relevant debit and credit entries were made in the respective accounts. On the same day, by two separate letters, the gifts were ac cepted by the sons and later on these amounts were withdrawn by the respective donees. In the case of second gift, oral instructions were given for transferring the amounts stand ing to his credit. The respondent assessee having failed before the Income Tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, ap pealed to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and contended that the first company was carrying on the business of banking and hence the gifts in question were valid, and that the Income Tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commis sioner had wrongly included these amounts in his net wealth and in the case of second gift, the assessee claimed that the amounts were gifted by him by transfer entries. The Tribunal found that there was no evidence that the first company was carrying on any banking business, and in the case of second gift, the sum was available with the company. It, therefore, held that the first company was not carrying on banking business, and in the 122 second case, there was no valid gift. It, however, referred the matter to the High Court. The High Court held that the Tribunal was not right in holding that the assessee did not make valid gifts and in holding that the amounts were rightly included in the net wealth of the assessee. Allowing the appeal by the Revenue, this Court, HELD: 1. In order to constitute a valid gift there must be an existing property. In case of entries in the books of account by credit and debit, the sums should be available on the date of gift in the account of the firm whose accounts are said to be credited or debited. In the case of banking companies or other firms and companies who have overdraft facilities, even if the sums are not in credit of the donor and are not with such companies or firms, gifts might be possible by adjustment of book entries. But in the cases of non banking companies or firms, if these companies or firms do not have overdraft facilities, it is not possible to make valid gift if sums or funds are not available. [126E G] 2. It is possible in certain circumstances for a donor to make a valid gift by instructing a firm or a company or H.U.F., in which the donor has an account to give effect to the gift by debiting his account and crediting the account in the name of the donee. But in such cases merely book entries would not suffice. The circumstances must be such as to make it clear that there were sufficient funds at the disposal of the donor by reason of which he could make the gift by such book entries. The firm in which the donor may have account may or may not have sufficient cash balance but it must have sufficient provision for overdraft with the bank on the basis of which it could honour instructions given by the assessee. [126H;127A B] 3. Each case must be decided on the facts of that case. Where the assessee has a credit account with a firm or with a family or with a banking company and that sum is available to that firm or the company or H.U.F. on the date of the gift, then a valid gift by book entries might be possible. But where a sum was not available with the firm or the H.U.F. or a company which was not a banking company or which had no overdraft facility, by mere book entries, even though there was acceptance of that gift by the donee a valid gift would not be effectuated. [131D E] 4. In the instant case, the entries in the books of account could not effectuate valid gifts. The only sum which could be taken by the donee was Rs.4,000 in the case of the first company, which had no 123 overdraft facility with the bank. Thus, there was no exist ing goods to be parted. The High Court was, therefore, in error in answering the questions against the Revenue. [132E F] [Appeal allowed.

        "reference": "The Orissa Superior Judicial Service consisted of 15 posts. 10 of which were District and Sessions Judges or Additional District and Sessions Judges; of the other five, one was Registrar of the High Court and four were officers of the State Government. P, one of the District and Sessions Judges was posted as Superintendent and Legal Remembrance in March 1962. B. an Additional Judge. was posted as Joint Secretary in the Law Department in the same month and sometime thereafter was posted as Superintendent and Legal Remembrance. D, a District and Sessions judge was posted in January 1962 as member. Sales Tax Tribunal, which was a non cadre post. In February 1965 the High Court took a policy decision to the effect that as a general rule, judicial officers working in special posts. whether cadre or non cadre. outside their regular line, should be called to the regular line after the completion of three years in the interest of the service as well as the officers, so that the officers did not become out of touch with judicial work. Although this policy decision was accepted by the State Government. it was not implemented ' in respect of P, B and D. The High Court being under the impression at the time that in law the Governor was the sole authority to effect the necessary transfers. did not take any action itself. After the decision of this Court in Ranga Mohammad 's case ; holding that the power to transfer Judges presiding over Courts vested with the High Court under article 235 of the Constitution. the High Court. issued an order on October 10. transferring P. B and D to judicial posts and posting to the administrative posts in their place, K. T and M who were doing judicial work till then. In pursuance of those orders K. T and M handed over charge of the posts they were holding and reported to the Secretariat for assuming charge of the administrative posts to which they were assigned. but the Government refused to accept them. The State Government directed P. B and D to continue in the posts they were previously holding and those officers acted in accordance with the orders of the Government. Consequently. some of the Sessions Divisions in the State were without District and Sessions Judges for several days and some Advocates practising in those Divisions filet/petitions before the High Court for a writ of mandamus against the Government. as well as the concerned officers to implement the transfers ordered by the High Court. They also sought a writ of quo warranto against P. B and D questioning the authority under which they were holding the administrative posts held by them until then. The High Court allowed the petition and directed the Governments to implement its orders forthwith. The Government implemented these orders on March 6. 1967 and thereafter appealed to this Court, by special leave. 155 HELD: (i) Although the High Court was within its powers. in posting P. B and D, the three officers holding administrative posts. as District and Sessions Judges, it was beyond its powers to post in their places three other officers to the administrative posts. Just as the executive cannot know the requirements of a particular court, the High Court cannot also know the requirements of any post in the Secretariat. It is for the Executive to say whether a particular officer would meet its requirements or not. The High Court cannot foist an officer on the Government. [163C D] While sparing the service of any judicial officer to the government it is open to the High Court to fix the period during which he may hold any executive post. At the end of that period, the government is bound to allow him to go back to his parent department unless the High Court agrees to spare his services for some more time. In other words, the period during which a judicial officer should serve in an executive post must be settled by agreement between the High Court and the government. If there is no such agreement it is open to the Government to send him back to his parent department at any time it pleases. It is equally open to the High Court to recall him whenever it thinks [163 F H] It was not the case of the contesting respondents that P, B and D did ' not have the necessary qualifications to hold the posts that they were holding or that they had not been validly appointed to those posts.

He claimed that this clause was intended to cover all co-sharers, not just those specifically mentioned in the first three clauses.\n* **Respondent's Argument:** The respondents argued that the interpretation of clause 'Fourthly' in Jagdish vs. Nathi Mal Kejriwal & Ors. case (supra) was correct and that the appellant's claim should be rejected. They argued that the clause was meant to cover all co-sharers, not just those specifically mentioned in the first three clauses.\n\n**Supreme Court's Decision:**\n\n* The Supreme Court overturned the lower court's decision and allowed the appeal.\n* The Court found that the interpretation of clause 'Fourthly' in Jagdish vs. Nathi Mal Kejriwal & Ors. case was incorrect.\n* The Court held that the Act's purpose was to protect the interests of co-sharers, and that the right of pre-emption should be available to all co-sharers, not just those specifically mentioned in the first three clauses.\n* The Court also found that the Act was not discriminatory and did not violate Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* The Supreme Court ordered the lower court to dismiss the appeal and decree the suit in favor of the appellant.\n* The appellant was ordered to deposit the sale price and stamp duty within three months, and the respondent was ordered to execute a conveyance of the land in the appellant's favor within one month of the deposit. \n* If the respondent fails to comply, the Court will appoint a Commissioner to execute the conveyance.\n\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The Supreme Court's decision emphasizes the importance of ensuring that laws are not discriminatory and that they protect the rights of all citizens.\n* The Court's decision also highlights the importance of interpreting legal provisions in a way that is consistent with the Constitution. \n* The case serves as a reminder that the interpretation of legal provisions can be complex and that the courts are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the law is applied fairly and justly.",
        "reference": "The appellant seeking to exercise the right of pre emption as a co sharer, i.e. father 's brother 's son of the vendors, contended that he fell within the expression 'other co sharers ' in clause 'Fourthly ' of section 15(1)(b) of the Punjab pre emption Act, 1913 and was, therefore, entitled to exercise the right of pre emption. The courts below negatived his contention following the decision of this Court in Jagdish & Ors. vs Nathi Mal Kej riwal & Ors. ; , In this appeal filed by special leave, the appellant submitted that since the suit land belonged to more than one co sharer and had not been sold jointly by all the co shar ers, he, as a co sharer, as entitled to claim the right of pre emption under clause 'fourthly 'of section 15(1)(b) and that in Jagdish 's case, the interpretation placed on the expression 'other co shar ers ' in section 15(1)(b) required reconsideration. Allowing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1. According to section 15 of the Act before its amendment in 1960, in the case of sale of share out of joint land or property, the right of pre emption was conferred firstly on the lineal descendants of the vendor in order of succession; secondly, in the co sharers, if any, who are agnates, in order of succession; thirdly, in persons not included under firstly or secondly above, in order of suc cession, who but for such sale would be entitled, on death of the 120 vendor, to inherit the land or property sold and fourthly, in the cosharers. [126 E F] 2. Section 15 after its amendment in 1960 provided that where the sale is of a share out of the joint land or property and is not by all the co sharers jointly, the right of pre emption was vested, first, in the sons or daughters or son 's son or daughter 's sons of the vendor or vendors; Secondly, in the brothers or brother 's sons of the vendor or vendors; Thirdly, in the father 's brother or father 's broth er 's sons of the vendor or vendors; Fourthly, in the other cosharers and Fifthly, in the tenants. [126 F G] 3. The legislature desired to confer the right of pre emption on specified family members of the vendor or vendors in the first three clauses of section 15(1)(b) and with a view to covering all the remaining co sharers not specifi cally mentioned in the preceding clauses it used the expres sion 'other co sharers ' in the fourth clause which was meant to serve as a residuary clause to ensure that no cosharer is left out. [126 G 127 A] 4. The expression 'other co sharers ' was used in the fourth clause of the said provision to ensure that no co sharer was left out or omitted and not to deny the right to kinsfolk co sharers covered by the preceding clauses. If the preceding clauses were not erased from the statute book as unconstitutional the kinsfolk would have exercised the right in the order of preference, for which no justification was found. The relations in the first three clauses of section 15(1)(b) may or may not be co sharers. The use of the ex pression 'other ' in clause fourthly conveys the possibility of their being cosharer also. [127 D F] 5. The purport of Atam Prakash 's case was that while cosharers were entitled to pre empt, the conferment of that right on certain kinsfolk based on the rule of consanguinity being a relic of the feudal past could not be tolerated. This Court never intended to exclude any specified co owners from the scope of clause fourthly of section 15(1)(b) of the Act. Once conferment of the right of preemption in favour of co sharers was considered to be a reasonable restriction on the right to hold, acquire and dispose of property under Article 19(1)(f), the same restriction was held to be valid when tested on the touchstone of Articles 14 or 15 of the Constitution. [127 B D] 121 6. What this Court disapproved as offensive to Articles 14 and 15 is the classification based on consanguinity and not on co ownership. The right of pre emption to co sharers is held to be intra vires the Constitution. Therefore, it is difficult to hold that this Court intended to deny the right of pre emption of those kinsfolk even if they happened to be co sharers, That would clearly be discriminatory. [127 F G] 7. The interpretation placed on clause 'fourthly ' of section 15(1)(b) of the Act by this court in Jagdish 's case was not correct on a proper construction of that clause after the preceding clause were held to be unconstitutional, the word 'other ' preceding the word 'co sharer ' is rendered redundant.

The Tribunal, to which the dispute was referred, partly granted the workmen 's demand. On appeal to this Court it was contended that section 61 of the debarred a person enti tled to any of the benefits under that Act from receiving similar benefit under the provisions of any other Act and as such the workmen were not entitled to the benefit of sick leave. Dismissing the appeals, HELD: (1) The , does not deal with the question of sick leave. The scheme of the benefits admissible under the Act does not cover the work men 's demand for sick leave to the extent allowed by the Tribunal. Section 61 is not applicable because the benefits granted by the Tribunal are not similar to those admissible under the Act. [84 C] The Hindustan Times Ltd., New Delhi vs Their Workmen [1964] 1 SCR 234 and Technological Institute of Textiles vs Its Workmen and others applied. (2) Sickness benefit under the Act cannot be said to be adequate, for, it works out to about half the average wage of a workman which benefit is not admissible for the first two days of sickness except under the conditions provided in the Act. A workman is prevented from earning the normal daily wages during the period of his illness and there is no justification for the argument that the rate of benefit at about half his wage, under the Act, should be considered sufficient so as to deny him the benefit of sick leave on full emoluments for a period of 7 days when he is certi fied by a competent medical officer to be ill for that or a longer period. Sickness is a serious misfortune to a work man for it not only prevents him from earning his normal wages, but is a drain on his meagre financial resources by way of additional expenditure on food, nursing and visits to the medical centre etc. [84 E F] (3) The Tribunal could not be said to have erred in restoring the benefit which the workmen were receiving under an earlier award. The benefit of sick leave to the employ ees in the region was lost when the Act was made applicable to the region from December 14, 1969. This was obviously under a mistaken impression. The Act does not deal with all aspects of sickness benefit and does not provide for the grant of leave on full emoluments during the period of a workman 's physical incapacity to earn his normal wages because of his sickness. [85 B C] (4) There is no force in the argument that the Tribunal had granted additional privilege leave for 7 days under the garb of sick leave because by its very nature sick leave would be admissible only in the case of actual sickness certified by a registered medical practitioner. [86 B] (5) There is no evidence to show that the benefit had not been allowed by other companies in the region. The Tribunal had examined the financial 81 capacity of the companies and had given adequate reasons for holding that they were in good financial position and could bear the additional burden.

        "reference": "Appellant was detained under section 3(1)(a)(i) of the Preventive Detention Act, Act IV of 1950 on the grounds that with the financial help given by the Portuguese authorities he was carrying on espionage on their behalf with the help of underground workers and that he was also collecting intelligence about the security arrangements on the border area and was making such intelligence available to the Portuguese authorities. Appellant made no application to the Government for further particulars. Held, that in these circumstances and having regard to the fact that what is alleged is espionage activity, the grounds could not be considered to be vague. In answer to the objection in the writ application before the High Court that the grounds were not specific and that no particular of the alleged activities of the appellant were given the Under Secretary to the Government in his affidavit claimed privilege under article 22(6) of the Constitution. Held, that the right of the detenue to be furnished particulars is subject to the limitation under article 22(6). Hence even if the grounds are vague due to the reason that facts cannot be disclosed in the public interest, the order of detention cannot be challenged on the ground of such vagueness. The necessity of communicating the decision to claim privilege under article 22(6) would arise only when the detenue asks for parti 383 culars. In the absence of any such request by the detenue, the noncommunication of the decision cannot be hold to have hampered his constitutional right to make his representation. Mala fides must be made out against the detaining authority and not against the police. The contention of mala fides is untenable in the present case having regard to the nature of the grounds and to the nature of the activities imputed to the appellant."

K. Rao was accused of misconduct involving an alleged attempt by him to help his friend's daughter elope with a sepoy. \n* **The Action:** The Central Government, after an inquiry, found Rao's conduct unbecoming of an officer and ordered his removal from service under Rule 14 of the Army Rules, 1954.\n* **Rao's Argument:** Rao challenged the removal, arguing that Rule 14 was \"ultra vires\" the Indian Army Act (the Act) and that the removal was without proper authority.\n\n**Key Points of the Judgment:**\n\n* **Rule 14:** This rule allows the Central Government to remove an officer from service if they deem it undesirable, even without a court martial. The rule requires the officer to submit an explanation and defense, and the Central Government can then decide on dismissal, removal, retirement, or resignation.\n* **Section 19 of the Act:** This section grants the Central Government the power to make rules for the removal of personnel from service, including the power to remove officers without a court martial.\n* **Section 45 of the Act:** This section deals with punishments for officers who behave unbecomingly. It states that officers found guilty by court martial can be cashiered or face other punishments.\n* **The Court's Decision:** The court found that Rule 14 is not \"ultra vires\" the Act. The court explained that:\n    * Section 19 grants the Central Government the power to make rules for removing personnel from service, and Rule 14 is such a rule.\n    * Section 19 and Section 45 are mutually exclusive, meaning they don't overlap. \n    * The removal under Rule 14 is not a violation of Section 45.\n* **Outcome:** The appeal was allowed, but the case was sent back to the High Court for further proceedings on the merits.\n\n**In essence, the court ruled that the Central Government has the power to remove officers from service without a court martial under Rule 14, even if it contradicts the punishment outlined in Section 45 of the Act.** \n\n\n**Important Note:** This summary provides a high-level overview of the legal document.

The Chief of the Army Staff was of the opinion that his trial by a General Court Martial was inexpedient, and the respondent was removed from service after following the procedure under r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954. On the question whether r. 14, which gives power to the Central Government to remove an officer without being tried and convicted by Court Martial was in derogation of section 45, , which specifically provides for conviction by court martial and punishment for unbecoming conduct, HELD : The rule is not ultra vires. [451 D] (1) Section 19 of the Act provides that subject to the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder the Central Government may remove from service, any person subject to the Act. Therefore, the section itself suggests that there should be rules regarding removal from service, and section 191 (2) (a) of the Act specifically gives power to make a rule providing for the removal from the service of persons subject to the Act. [450 H; 451 A B] (2) Although section 19 uses the words \"subject to the provisions of this Act\", the section is not subject to section 45. The power under section 19 is independent of the power under section 45, because, while section 19 speaks of removal of a person, section 45 provides that on conviction by Court Martial an officer is liable to be cashiered or to suffer such less punishment as is in the Act mentioned.

        "reference": "The appellant Panchayat levied octroi duty on goods coming within its limits by following the procedure laid down in rr. 3 and 4 of the Maharashtra Village Panchayats Taxes and Fees Rules 1960. Although the resolution finally levying octroi was passed on February 25, 1963 and the octroi limits were fixed by resolution dated March 17, 1963 the approval of the Collector to the octroi limits as required by r. 21 was not obtained till January 14, 1964. When the Panchayat began collecting octroi on April 1, 1963 the respondent company appealed under section 124(5) of the Bombay Village Panchayat Act, 1958 to the Panchayat Samita. The appeal was rejected as it was considered time barred under r. 5 of the Taxes & Fees Rules which required an appeal under section 124(5) of the Act to be filed within 60 days of the publication of the notice under r. 4. On further appeal the Standing Committee, Zila Parishad, Nagpur decided in favour of the respondent company on the ground that the Panchayat had not complied with r. 21. The Panchayat filed a writ petition under article 226 of the Constitution. The High Court upheld the findIng of the Standing Committee as to the effect of non compliance with r. 21. It however further held that r. 5 in requiring all appeals under a. 124(5) of the Act to be filed within 60 days of the publication of the notice under section 4 was arbitrary and destructive of the right of appeal and therefore ultra vires. The Panchayat appealed to this Court. Held: (i) Octroi can be validly levied under r. 22 after following the procedure in rr. 3 and 4 Rule 3 deals only with (i) selection of the tax and (ii) the rate at which it is to be levied. Rule 4 deals with final publication of the notice levying octroi. The levy of octroi under r. 22 read with rr. 3 and 4 does not require prior approval to the octroi limits by the Collector under r. 21. [219D H; 220A C]. (ii) However the octroi cannnot be validly collected before the octroi limits are approved by the Collector under r. 21. Collections made earlier cannot be regularised by subsequent approval. The plea on behalf of the appellant that the approval of the Collector on January 14, 1964 should relate back to April 1, 1963 could not be accepted. [220 D E]. (iii) Rule 5 is not invalid as it does not apply to all appeals under, section 124(5). The rule follows rr. 3 and 4 and is headed \"appeal against levy of any tax or fee,\" and the period of sixty days of limitation commences from the date of the publication of the notice 214 under r. 4 i.e. the notice following the decision of a Panchayat to levy any tax or fee. This date shows that r. 5 is dealing only with appeals against levy of any tax and not with the assessment or imposition of a tax or any further appeals to the Panchayat Samiti under section 124(5). In its context and setting the heading of r. 5 brings out the scope of the rule, [220 F H]. Accordingly the appeal of the company to the Samiti was wrongly dismissed as time barred. It followed from this that the Standing Committee was entitled to deal with the appeal on merits. [220 H]."

Several criminal cases were pending against the appellant when the aforesaid order was passed. The appellant had already surrendered in respect of a criminal charge against him before the order was served. He filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the detention order, but it was dismissed without any speaking order. Aggrieved by the order of the High Court, the appellant filed the present criminal appeal by special leave as also a writ petition challenging the aforesaid order of detention on the ground that the order of preventive detention could only be justified against a person in detention if the detaining authority was satisfied that his release from detention was imminent and the order of detention was necessary for putting him back in jail. The service of order of detention on the appellant/ petitioner while he was in jail was futile and useless since such an order had no application under section 3(2) of the Act. Allowing the writ petition and the appeal in part, ^ HELD: 1. The continued detention of the detenu under the Act is not justified. The order of detention therefore is set aside. However, this will not affect detenu 's detention under the criminal cases. If however, the detenu is released on bail in the criminal cases already pending against him, the matter of service of the detention order under the Act may be reconsidered by the appropriate authority in accordance with law.

In our constitutional framework, the power of directing preventive detention given to the appropriate authorities must be exercised in exceptional cases as contemplated by the various provisions of the different statutes dealing with preventive detention and should be used with great deal of circumspection. There must be awareness of the facts necessitating preventive custody of a person for social defence. If a man is in custody and there is no imminent possibility of his being released, the power of preventive detention should not be exercised.

There is no indication that this factor or the question that the said detenu might be released or that there was such a possibility of his release was taken into consideration by the detaining authority properly and seriously before the service of the order. If there were cogent materials for thinking that the detenu might be released, then these should have been made apparent. In the affidavits on behalf of the detaining authority though there are indications that transfer of detenu from one prison to another was considered but the need to serve the detention order while he was in custody was not properly considered by the detaining authority in the light of relevant factors.

This lack of clarity makes the Administrator's decisions arbitrary and unfair to the dealers.\n* **The Court's Counter Argument:** The Court disagreed with the High Court's reasoning, arguing that:\n    * Section 28 is part of a larger scheme of the Gold Control Act, which aims to control gold trade for economic and financial stability.\n    * The Act's purpose is to prevent circumvention of other provisions, and the Administrator must consider this when exercising his discretion.\n    * The Act requires the Administrator to consider the Act's policy and purposes, and there is a mechanism for review of his decisions.\n    * The language of Section 28 is not vague or indefinite, unlike the clauses in Section 27(6) of the Act that the High Court used as a precedent for striking down Section 28.\n    * The High Court's analogy to the case of Harakchand Banthia is not applicable because the clauses in Section 27(6) were vague and lacked objective standards, while Section 28 is clear and specific.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* The Court overturned the High Court's decision and upheld the constitutionality of Section 28.\n* The appeal was successful, but since the respondents (the gold dealers) did not appear, no costs were awarded.\n\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The Court emphasized the importance of a clear legislative framework when granting power to administrative officials.\n* The Court highlighted the need for a balance between the government's power to regulate and the individual's right to fair and transparent decision-making.\n* The case demonstrates the importance of considering the context and purpose of legislation when evaluating its constitutionality. \n\n\nThis summary provides a concise overview of the legal document.

        "reference": "Section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968 bars money lending business to be carried on in licensed premises, either by the licensed dealer or by any other person unless authorised by the Administrator to do so. Drawing analogy from the reasoning adopted by the Supreme Court in its decision reported in Harakchand Ratanchand Banthia vs Assistant Collector or Central Excise, Poona, II Division, [1970] I SCR 479=AIR , the High Court of Andhra Pradesh struck down the said provision on the ground that it suffers from the vice of excessive delegation of legislative power in as much, as no criteria or guidelines have been provided by reference to which the power conferred on the Administrator to refuse permission or grant permission should be exercised and that the section confers an arbitrary, uncanalised and unfettered power upon the Administrator with the result that the licensed dealer is at his mercy while seeking permission to carry on money lending or banking business on the security of any article, ornament or both in the same premises in which he carried on business as such dealer. Hence the appeal by special leave. Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: 1.1 Section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968 cannot be struck down on the ground of excessive delegation of legislative power and its validity must be upheld. [957C] 1.3 It is true that no express rule prescribing the conditions or circumstances under which the permission can be granted or refused has been framed nor any particular guide line has been expressly indicated in section 28 by reference to which the power conferred upon him thereunder could be exercised by the Administrator, but that is not decisive of the matter. [954H; 955A] 952 1.3 Section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968 is part and parcel of the entire scheme of the Gold Control Act the objective, the policy and the scheme of the Act together with the necessity to ensure prevention of circumvention of the other provisions of the Act afford more than sufficient guidance to the Administrator in the matter of exercising the power or discretion conferred on him under section 28. The several restrictions that have been put on the activities of the traders doing business in gold will have to be viewed, in the light of the purpose or which the Gold Control Act was passed viz., that even though import of gold into India had been banned considerable quantities of contraband gold were finding their way into the country through illegal channels affecting the national economy and hampering the country 's economic stability and progress, that the Customs Department was not in a position to effectively combat the smuggling over the long borders and coast line that therefore anti smuggling measures had to be supplemented by a detailed system of control over internal transactions. In fact section 5 (1) of the Act requires that the Administrator should have regard to the policy and purposes of the Act in making his orders. Moreover against his order under that section a revision lies to Central Government which implies that be will have to make judicious use of his power or discretion and any improper exercise is liable to be corrected by a higher authority. Therefore, it cannot be! said that unfettered or uncanalised or arbitrary power has been conferred upon the Administrator under section 28. 1955B; E G] 1.4 further section 28 does not impose any blanket or absolute prohibition upon a dealer from carrying on money lending, banking or any other business in the same promises in which he carries on business as a dealer but he is prevented only from carrying in business as money lender or banker on the security of any article, ornament or both unless authorised by the Administrator. Even the restriction in the case of a third person in carrying on business as a money lender, banker or any other business in the same premises is not absolute in as much as the Administrator can authorise the third person to carry of the business in the licensed premises of the dealer and while implementing such limited restrictions or granting relief against the same he will be guided by the policy and purposes of the Act and by the prime consideration that circumvention of the other provisions of the Act shall not be permitted.

The case concerns the validity of a series of sales of land belonging to a Hindu temple in India. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**Background:**\n\n* The case involves a dispute over the ownership of land belonging to a Hindu temple in India.\n* The land was allegedly sold by the temple's managers (called \"Shebait\") to individuals who claimed to own the property as their own.\n* The plaintiffs (the temple) sought to recover possession of the land from the defendants (the individuals who purchased the land).\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n\n* **Article 134 B of the Limitation Act:** This article of the Indian Limitation Act governs suits to recover possession of property transferred by a previous manager of a Hindu religious endowment. The plaintiffs argued that the sales were void and the defendants' possession was adverse to the temple.\n* **Interpretation of Article 134 B:** The Supreme Court had to determine whether the article applies to sales made by temple managers who claimed the property was their own, rather than belonging to the temple.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n* **Plaintiff's Argument:** The plaintiffs argued that the sales were void because the managers acted outside their authority and the transfers were not made in the interest of the temple.

        "reference": "The lands in dispute had been granted in inam to a temple. By about 1929 the then manager of the temple disposed of all those properties under various sale deeds, resigned his position and left the village. He was therefore removed from the management of the temple and other persons had taken up the position as de facto managers from 1929. As a result of successive alienations of the properties, the appellants became entitled to them. In 1951, the respondents were appointed trustees of The temple and under the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1951, they applied, to the Magistrate, for possession of the properties and the Magistrate ordered delivery of possession. Before the order could be executed the appellants filed the suit in 1954, for a declaration of their title to the properties and for an injunction restraining the respondents from interfering with their possession. The trial Court and the lower appellate Court decreed the suit. In second appeal, the High Court held that the suit was governed by article 134 B of the Limitation Act,, 1908, which was introduced into the Act on 1st January 1929; and that the appellants ' claim in regard to the properties covered by the sale deeds of 1917 and 1926. should be rejected, because, the alienees had not acquired title by adverse possession by 1st January, 1929, and is the alienor was still alive, the plea of adverse possession could not be sustained under that article. In appeal to this Court it was contended that article 134 B would not apply to the present case but that article 144 would apply, because, the transfers were effected by the alienor on the 'representations that the properties belonged to him as his separate property; and that even if the article applied, the decision of the High Court was erroneous, because the transferor had been removed from management more than 12 years before the suit was filed. HELD : Though article 134 B applied to the facts of the case, since the appellants had acquired title to the properties by prescription, the decree passed by the High Court, in so far as it was against the appellants, should be set aside. Column 1 of the article provides for suits brought,, inter alia, by the Tanager of a Hindu religion; or charitable endowment to recover possession of immovable property comprised in the endowment, which has been transferred by a previous manager for valuable consideration. The period Prescribed for such suits is 12 years, and the time from which the period begins to run is the death, resignation or removal of the transferor. The findings recorded by the High Court in the present case show that all the ingredients prescribed by the first column of the Article namely 121 (i)that the property belonged to the endowment, (ii) that it was transferred by a previous manager; and (iii) that the transfer was for valuable Consideration, were satisfied. The character of the representations made by the previous manager in regard to his relation with the property which is the subject matter of transfer, is irrelevant for the purpose of the Article. But if a suit had been brought by the respondents on the date when they were appointed trustees, it would have been barred under the Article, because more than 12 years had elapsed since the date of the removal of the previous manager who had transferred the properties; and therefore, the trial Court and the lower appellate Court were right in decreeing the, appellants ' suit in its entirety.

It also emphasizes the importance of following the proper legal procedures when dealing with licensing authorities.",
        "reference": "The appellant, purporting to Act on behalf of a partnership consisting of himself, Todar Mal and Krishan Kumar, applied for and obtained permission in his individual capacity to construct a cinema theatre on a plot of land which was taken on lease jointly by all the three of them after the application for the permission was made but before the same was granted. They entered into a partnership along with 11 others for carrying on the business of constructing and running a cinema theatre and the deed of partnership contained a clause that the plot of land as well as the permission obtained for constructing the theatre shall be the property of the firm. On completion of the construction the appellant applied for, in his own name, and obtained in his personal capacity, a licence to exhibit cinematograph films at the Theatre. The partnership was re constituted on retirement of two partners and the new deed executed by the remaining partners also contained a clause that the firm shall have the right to operate the licence. An application for inclusion of the names of Todar Mal and Krishan Kumar in the licence was rejected by an order of the Licensing Authority who held that the appellant was the sole licensee and the said order became final. Another application for renewal of the licence in the name of the Theatre on the ground that the appellant had been expelled from the partnership was also rejected by an order of the Licensing Authority which was not challenged. Thereafter when, in a suit instituted for a declaration that the licence was the property of the firm, the trial court issued an injunction restraining the appellant from interfering with the possession and running of the Theatre by some of the partners of the firm, the appellant wrote to the Licensing Authority disclaiming responsibility for any acts of commission or omission committed by others in the premises of the Theatre. The Licensing Authority, acting on a report from the police that films were being exhibited in the Theatre by persons other than the licensee, ordered suspension of exhibition of films at the Theatre. A writ petition challenging the validity of this order filed in the name of the Theatre was dismissed by a Single Judge of the High Court. In tho Letters Patent Appeal heard by a Division Bench consisting of the Acting Chief Justice another Judge of the High Court the Acting Chief Justice held that the impugned order was void but the other Judge agreed with the view of the Single Judge who had dismissed the petition earlier. In view of 576 the divergence of opinion, the matter was referred to the only other Judge available in the High Court, but he having declined to hear the same for good reason, the Division Bench decided under sub r. (3) of r. 23 of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Rules, 1975 that the view of the Senior Judge should pre vail and accordingly the Letters Patent Appeal was allowed in conformity with the view taken by the Acting Chief Justice. This resulted in the anomalous situation that as against the view concurrently taken by two Judges of the High Court, the opinion of the Acting Chief Justice which was really the minority view was allowed to prevail. The reasons given by the Acting Chief Justice for the view he took were: (i) that a licence under the provisions of the Jammu and Kashmir (Cinematograph) Act is granted for premises permanently equipped for cinematograph exhibition in the name of the owner/manager of the cinematographs used in the premises and hence, where the licensed premises including the cinematograph used therein belongs to a partnership and one of the partners obtains a licence in his separate name, the other partners automatically acquire an interest in the licence and that the privilege granted by the licensing authority \"must necessarily follow the title in such building and the cinematograph\" and that the provision contained in section 6F lends support to this conclusion; (ii) that the partnership firm had a legal right in the licence which entitled it to notice and hearing under the Act before the licence was suspended; (iii) that inasmuch as the said procedure was not followed by the Licensing Authority the impugned order was void and in violation of principles of natural justice and (iv) that except for the power of revocation of licence embodied in section 6F and an implied power to suspend a licence pending proceedings for revocation, the Licensing Authority had no power to suspend the licence of the Theatre under any other circumstances. Allowing the appeal, ^ HELD: The provisions of the Act and the Rules contemplate the grant of a licence to a person in respect of a `place ' where cinematographic apparatus have been installed. Under the Rules and the terms and conditions of the licence, the grantee thereof is the person answerable to the Licensing Authority for breach of the obligations and conditions. A licence granted under the Act is not analogous to a licence in the realm of real property law. It is, therefore, not possible to accept the view that the licence is a grant for the premises and constitutes an interest attached to the premises. The provision contained in section 6F, far from supporting such a view, goes to show that the holder of a licence may be a person different from the owner or partner of a cinematograph. The object of that section is to empower the Licensing Authority to revoke the licence in the event of commission of an offence under s: 6 or 6E not merely by the licensee but also by any person who may be in actual charge of the cinematograph. [588 H, 589 A B, G H, 590 A] 2. (a) In proceedings to which the Licensing Authority was a party, the High Court as well this Court had upheld the order of the Licensing Authority holding the appellant to be the sole licensee and rejecting the case Put forward 577 on behalf of the firm. The firm and its partners are bound by the said decision. It is, therefore, unnecessary to deal with the reasons stated by the Acting Chief Justice of the High Court in support or his concussion that the licence was granted to the appellant in his individual capacity as representing the partnership. [588 D F] (b) The appellant was the sole licence in respect of the Theatre. By virtue of r. 88 (v) as well as cl. 11 of the licence issued, there was a clear prohibition against the licensee from transferring, assigning, sub letting or otherwise transferring the licence without the permission of the Licensing Authority and also against his allowing any other person to exhibit films at the licensed place without obtaining such permission. The firm of partners had no right whatever to exhibit cinematograph films at the theatre without a licence. It was the plain duty of the Licensing Authority to ensure that exhibition of films was not conducted in the Theatre by unautuorised persons and the impugned order is obviously one passed by him in the discharge of the said function. The principles of natural justice are not attracted to such a situation. The position would have been different if it was a case of even temporary suspension of the licence without notice to the licensee. A, 592 A, C F] (c) The Licensing Authority had the power to make tho impugned order suspending the exhibition of films in the Theatre by persons other than the licensee. The power to control the exhibition of cinematography by grant of licence and the power to administer and enforce the provisions of the Act and the rules included the implied power to take all steps necessary to ensure the due observance of the terms of the statute. the rules and the conditions of licence. The view expressed in the impugned judgment of the High Court that the Licensing Authority had no power to make the impugned order was based on the fallacious assumption that what was done under the impugned order was to suspend the licence while, in fact, what was done was only to suspend the exhibition of films in the Theatre by persons other than the licensee. [593 D F, B] 3. Although there are very serious doubts about the correctness of the view taken by the Division Bench of the High Court regarding the applicability of r. 23 (3) of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Rules, 1975 to the instant case, it is not necessary to consider that question in view of the conclusion arrived at on the merits on the case.

The appellants argued that this power only applies to leases granted by the evacuee, not the Custodian himself.\n* **Section 10 of the Evacuee Property Act:** This section deals with the direction of the Custodian regarding the property of the evacuee. The appellants argued that the Custodian lacked authority to issue directions regarding the movables (stock, etc.) in the mills and factory.\n\n**Court Decisions:**\n\n* **Bombay High Court (Tendolkar, J.):** Initially, the High Court agreed with the appellants' argument that Section 12 only applies to leases granted by the evacuee, and the Custodian lacked the power to cancel the lease.\n* **Bombay High Court (Chagla, C.J. and Dixit, J.):** The High Court reversed the decision of Tendolkar, J., arguing that Section 12 applies to leases granted by the Custodian as well. However, they agreed with Tendolkar, J. that the Custodian had no authority to issue directions regarding the movables.\n\n**Amendment to the Act:**\n\n* A subsequent amendment to the Evacuee Property Act (1954) clarified that the Custodian has the power to cancel leases granted by him, including those granted by the Custodian himself.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* The appeal was dismissed, and the court upheld the High Court's decision.

The respondent who was the Custodian of evacuee property granted a lease to the appellants and subsequently issued a notice to them, among other things, calling upon them to show cause why the lease should not be cancelled for committing breaches of the conditions on which the properties had been leased to them. The appellants contended that the respondent had no power to cancel the lease on the ground that under section 12(1) of the Act the power of the Custodian to cancel the lease could be exercised only so as to override a bar imposed by any law but not the contract under which the lease was held and relied on the language of the non obstante clause contained in the section. Held, that the operative portion of the section which confers power on the Custodian to cancel a lease is unqualified and absolute and could not be abridged by reference to the non obstante clause which was only inserted ex abundanti cautela with a view to repel a possible contention that the section does not by implication repeal statutes conferring rights on lessees.

        "reference": "Proceedings were commenced under Chapter III B of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act 1955 for determining the ceiling area for Raghubir Singh, the father of the appellant. In a revision application in the first round of litigation. The Board of Revenue directed that the ceiling area for Raghubir Singh may be determined according to the old law, i.e. Act of 1955, and not according to the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973. Thereafter, by his order dt. 5.5.76, the SDO held, inter alia, that tile father and the son, appellant, constituted two separate units and each of them was entitled to get 62 bighas and 8 biswas. Aggrieved by the SDO 's order, Raghubir Singh filed an appeal before Revenue Appellate Authority, which was dismissed. He then filed a revision application under S.230 of the Act of 1955 before the Board of Revenue for Rajasthan. He urged that he was in possession of 112 bighas only and sought permission to adduce additional evidence, which was disallowed. However, the Member of the Board held inter alia that the provisions of the old law applied to the case, but the SDO had committed an error of law in determining the ceiling area under the new Act of 1973. The Board further held that there is no provision for separate units in Chapter III B of the Act of 1955, and remanded the case to the SDO, Hanumangarh, for fresh determination of the Ceiling area for Raghubir Singh. Before the High Court, it was urged that the State having not appealed against the order of the SDO dated 5.5.76, it became final, and the Board of 723 Revenue had no jurisdiction to set aside that part of the SDO 's order which had gone against the State and in his favour. It was submitted that the power of general superintendence and control over all revenue courts which vested in the Board could not be exercised to the detriment of the writ petitioners much less by way of suo motu exercise of powers. The High Court dismissed the petitions. Before this court it was submitted that the State not having filed an appeal, or a revision, the Board of Revenue could not, while hearing the revision petition of Raghubir Singh, set aside the orders of the SDO and Revenue Appellate Authority under S.221 of the Act of 1955. Dismissing the appeal, this court, HELD:. .(1) S.221 is not subject to the other provisions of the Act. It is clear from the language of Section 221 of the Act 1955 that the Board of Revenue has general powers of superintendence and control over all revenue courts. It is both administrative as well as judicial powers. It is open to the Board to exercise its powers of superintendence on all its subordinate courts in order to regulate the functioning of the subordinate courts so as to keep them within their respective spheres of jurisdiction. If the subordinate court disregards any specific provision of law and does something illegal it is open to the Board of Revenue to interfere and set the matter right.

        "reference": "HELD: The Court was concerned with the narrow question whether the six law reports aforementioned being published by the 1st respondent were newspapers within the meaning of the Act and whether the employees engaged in their production or distribution were entitled to the benefit of the orders made by the Central Government on the basis of the Palekar Award. [781F] In order to be a newspaper, a work must be (i) a printed work, (ii) a periodical, and (iii) should contain public news or comments on public news. Any other class of printed periodical work as may, from time to time, be notified in this behalf by the Central Government in the official Gazette, may also be a newspaper. There was no dispute in this case that the law reports are printed works and that they are periodicals. The only question which remained to be considered was whether they contained public news or comments on public news, Newspapers and 776 books are no doubt shown as separate items in Entry 39 of List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, but the distinction between them sometimes becomes very thin or totally vanishes. [781G H;782A B] The law reports being published by the 1st respondent are reports of recent decisions of the Supreme Court of India and the High Courts in India, which are supplied to it by its agents appointed at New Delhi and other places where the High Courts are situated. These decisions are of public importance. The law declared by the Supreme Court is binding on all the Courts in India, as provided by Article 141 of the Constitution. The decisions of the Supreme Court a court of record constitute a source of law as they are judicial precedents of the highest court of the land. They are binding on all the courts throughout India. The decisions of every High Court being judicial precedents are binding on all the Courts situated in the territory under the jurisdiction of the High Court. The decisions of the Supreme Court and High Courts are almost as important as statutes, rules and regulations passed by the competent legislatures and other bodies. The decisions of the superior courts, while they settle the disputes between the parties to the proceedings, are sources of law in so far as all others are concerned. As soon as a decision is rendered, the members of the public would be interested in knowing it; lawyers and others connected with the courts and judicial proceedings are interested in knowing the contents and effects of the decisions. The 1st respondent and other publishers of law reports, in the interests of their own business, vie with each other to publish the judgments of the Supreme Court or the High Courts as early as possible in their law reports, published periodically weekly, fortnightly or monthly. They believe the faster the decisions are published in their reports, the larger will be the number of subscribers. The contents of these law reports constitute news in so far as the subscribers and readers of these reports are concerned. By reading these law reports, they come to know of the latest legal position prevailing in the country on any question decided in the decisions reported in the said reports. Hence, it was difficult to agree with the submission of the 1st respondent that the law reports did not carry any news and that the public was not interested in them. Any decision published in the law reports of the 1st respondent contains information about the recent events which have taken place in the Supreme Court or the High Courts which are public bodies and these are matters in which public is interested. The Court found it also difficult to agree with the submission of the 1st respondent that since the law reports are going to be preserved by the lawyers as reference books after getting them rebound subsequently, they should be treated as books. The decisions contained in these law reports may 777 cease to be items of news after some time, but when they are received by the subscribers, they do possess the character of works containing news. [782G H; 783A H] Strong reliance was placed by the 1st respondent on the decision of the High Court of Orissa in P.S.V. Iyer vs Commissioner of Sales Tax, Orissa, AIR 1960 Orissa 221, but the Court found it difficult to agree with that decision since the High Court had omitted to take into consideration that information about recent decisions of the Courts of record could be news in which the public was interested. The fact that a law book could be used as a reference book at a later stage was not sufficient to hold that the law report did not contain public news when it was received by the subscriber. [784A, G H] It is sufficient that the expression 'newspaper ' as defined in the Act includes not merely 'public news ' but also 'comments on public news '. Every law report contains the editorial note and also comments on some of the recent decisions. The law Reports also contain newly enacted Acts, Rules and Regulations, book reviews and advertisements relating to law books, handwriting and finger print experts, etc., speeches made at conferences in which the legal fraternity is interested, etc. Though the publication of these items by itself may not occupy a substantial part of a law report to make it a newspaper, the publication of the recent judgments itself is sufficient to make a law report a newspaper which may after some time cease to be a newspaper and become a book of reference. [786G H; 787A B] The Act is a beneficient legislation which is enacted for improving the conditions of service of the employees of the newspaper establishments, and even if it is possible to have two opinions on the construction of the provisions of the Act, the one which advances the object of the Act and is in favour of the employees for whose benefit the Act is passed has to be accepted. [787B C] The Law Reports published by the 1st respondent are newspapers and the employees employed by the 1st respondent in their production or publication should be extended the benefit of the orders passed by the Central Government on the basis of the recommendations made by the Palekar Award.[787C D] The judgment of the High Court was set aside and the writ petition filed by the 1st respondent before the High Court was dismissed.

He relied on the Bombay High Court's decision in *Mrs. M.N. Clubwala and others vs Fida Hussain Saheb and others* and other similar cases.\n* **Respondent's Argument:** The respondent argued that the agreement was a license because it limited the use of the premises to a specific business purpose and imposed restrictions on the licensee's use. They also argued that the agreement did not grant exclusive possession.\n\n**The Court's Decision:**\n\n* **The High Court:** The High Court initially dismissed the appeal, finding that the agreement was a license and not a lease.\n* **The Appeal:** The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of India, arguing that the High Court's decision was incorrect.\n* **The Supreme Court's Decision:** The Supreme Court agreed with the High Court's decision, finding that the agreement was a license and not a lease. The Court emphasized the importance of the parties' intention and the specific terms of the agreement.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* **Intent:** The Supreme Court emphasized that the intention of the parties is crucial in determining the nature of the agreement.\n* **Restrictions:** The Court noted that the agreement's restrictions on the licensee's use of the premises were indicative of a license, not a lease.\n* **Estoppel:** The Supreme Court did not consider the issue of estoppel, which is a legal principle that prevents someone from claiming something they previously agreed not to.\n* **Jurisdiction:** The Supreme Court affirmed the High Court's decision, finding no error in its interpretation of the agreement.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, finding that the agreement between the parties was a license, not a lease. The Court emphasized the importance of the parties' intent and the specific terms of the agreement in determining the nature of the agreement.",
        "reference": "% The appellant, who was stated to be a monthly tenant of the suit premises, entered into an agreement, which was described as an agreement of 'leave and licence ', with the respondent on 9th February, 1965 and the respondent and the appellant were described therein as licensor and licensee respectively. It was stated in the agreement that the licensor was seized of the premises in dispute as a monthly tenant and gave and granted 'leave and license ' to the licensee to use and occupy the said premises for a period of five years, merely for the purpose of workshop business, at a monthly compensation of Rs.225 that the licensor shall be entitled to terminate the agreement and cancel and revoke and withdraw the leave and licence granted earlier and to take possession forthwith of the said premises if the licensee committed any default of any terms and conditions or failed to pay the compensation for two months or if the licensee at any time put up false or adverse claim of tenancy or sub tenancy, that the licensee shall pay the electric charges in respect of consumption of electricity and the rent of the said premises should be paid by the licensor only, and that the licensor shall have the full right to enter upon the premises and inspect the same at any time. 1058 In November 1970, the respondent filed an ejectment proceedings against the appellant under section 41 of the . It was contended by the appellant that there was sub tenancy by the respondent in his favour as monthly tenant. The trial court passed a decree and ordered the appellant to vacate the premises holding that the agreement was for leave and licence and that the appellant was a licensee and not a subtenant. On the case being remanded by the Supreme Court in a Special Leave Petition filed by the respondent against the earlier decision of the High Court, allowing the appellant 's special civil application, the High Court upheld the order of the Court of Small Causes, and ordered eviction of the appellant. In the Special Leave Petition against the aforesaid decision, it was contended that the document in question read as a whole was a lease and not a license. Dismissing the appeal by special leave, ^ HELD: 1.1 If an interest in immovable property entitling the transferee to enjoyment was created, it was lease; if permission to use land without exclusive possession was alone granted, a licence was the legal result. [1067D E] 1.2 In determining whether an agreement creates between the parties the relationship of landlord and tenant or merely that of licensor and licensee, decisive consideration is the intention of the parties. [1068B C] In view of the intention of the parties in the document and the facts and circumstances of the instant case, it was a licence and not a lease. This is clear from the language used and the restrictions put upon the use of the premises in question by the appellant. In the document in question the expression \"licence\" was introduced and clause (2) said that it was only for the business purposes. The licence fee was fixed. It permitted user only for 20 hours. Restriction in the hours of work negates the case for lease. Clause (12) gives to the licensor right to enter upon the premises and inspect the same at any time. [1067E F] 1059 1.3 Where two views are possible and the trial court has taken one view which is a possible and plausible view merely because another view is attractive, the High Court should not interfere and would be in error in interfering with the finding of the trial court or interfering under Article 227 of the Constitution over such decision.

The case concerns the liability of the State of Rajasthan to refund export duty paid in advance by a respondent, who was a resident of the former Dholpur State, which was merged into the State of Rajasthan.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of the key points:**\n\n**Background:**\n\n* **Political Changes:** The case arises from a series of political changes in India after independence. Several states were formed through mergers and agreements, including the formation of the State of Rajasthan.\n* **Dholpur State:** The former Dholpur State was a part of the former princely state of Rajasthan.\n* **Merger and Covenants:**  The merger of states involved agreements (Covenants) that transferred assets and liabilities from the merging states to the new state.\n* **Article 295(2):** This article of the Indian Constitution states that the Government of each State specified in Part B of the First Schedule shall, as from the commencement of the Constitution, be the successor of the Government of the corresponding Indian State as regards all property and assets and all rights, liabilities and obligations.\n\n**The Dispute:**\n\n* **Liability of Rajasthan:** The respondent claimed that the State of Rajasthan was liable to refund the export duty paid in advance by him, as he was a resident of the former Dholpur State.\n* **State's Argument:** The State of Rajasthan argued that it was not bound by any obligation arising from the former Dholpur State.\n\n**The Court's Reasoning:**\n\n* **Recognition of Liability:** The Supreme Court held that the State of Rajasthan was liable to refund the export duty because the new state recognized the rights and liabilities of the former states through the Covenants and the continued application of the old laws.\n* **Article 295(2):** The Court relied on Article 295(2) of the Constitution, which states that the Government of each State specified in Part B of the First Schedule shall be the successor of the Government of the corresponding Indian State.\n* **Historical Context:** The Court emphasized that the historical context of the mergers and the Covenants clearly indicated that the new state intended to assume the liabilities of the former states.\n* **Dalmia Dadri Cement Co. Ltd. Case:** The Court cited the *Dalmia Dadri Cement Co. Ltd. vs. The Commissioner of Incometax* case, which established that the new state could be held liable for the liabilities of the former state if it continued the old laws and recognized the rights of the subjects under those laws.\n* **Raja sthan Administration Ordinance No. 1 of 1949:** The Court also referred to the Raja sthan Administration Ordinance, which continued existing laws of the old states until they were altered by the new state.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n* The Supreme Court held that the State of Rajasthan was liable to refund the export duty paid by the respondent.\n* The Court rejected the State's argument that it was not bound by any obligation arising from the former Dholpur State.\n* The Court emphasized that the new state recognized the rights and liabilities of the former states through the Covenants and the continued application of the old laws.\n\n\n**Key Legal Principles:**\n\n* **Succession of Governments:** The Constitution provides for the transfer of power and liabilities from one government to another.\n* **Recognition of Rights:** The new state must recognize the rights of the subjects of the former state.\n* **Liability of the New State:** The new state is liable for the liabilities of the former state if it continues the old laws and recognizes the rights of the subjects under those laws.\n* **Interpretation of Article 295(2):** The Court interpreted Article 295(2) to mean that the new state is bound by the liabilities of the former state. \n\n\nThis case highlights the complex legal issues that arise when states merge and the implications for the rights and liabilities of the former states.",
        "reference": "In 1947, the Dholpur State acceded to the Dominion of India. Later on, it was merged with other States and as a result of that merger, the Matsya Union was formed on March 18, 1948. One of the provisions of the merger agreement was that the existing laws in the Covenanting States were to be continued till such time as they were modified or repealed by the new State and that all the assets and liabilities of the Covenanting States were taken over by the new State. Later on, the Matsya Union was merged with the United State of Rajasthan which had come into existence from April 7, 1949. A similar provision with regard to the recognition of the liabilities of the Covenanting States by the new State was also provided. On January 26, 1950, Part B State of Rajasthan came into existence. In the four appeals the respondents secured permits from the Dholpur State for the export of certain commodities and they had to pay export duties in advance. As the respondents could not export the full quantity for which they had secured permits they asked the appellant to refund the excess export duty and when the latter refused to do so, filed suits for refund of the same with interest. The defence taken up by the appellant was that it was not bound by any liability which might have arisen against the former State of Dholpur. It was a new Sovereign and was not bound by any liability of the former State of Dholpur unless it chose to recognise the obligation but no such obligation was recognised in the present case. One suit was dismissed by the trial court and other three were decreed. The appeals of the State to the District Judge were substantially dismissed while the appeal in the first suit by the plaintiff was substantially allowed. The State filed appeals to the High Court. After referring the matter to the Full Bench, a Division Ben oh of the High Court dismissed the appeals filed by the State. The Appellant came to this Court after obtaining certificate of fitness from the High Court. The only question raised before this Court was about the liability of the State of Rajasthan under article 295(2) of the Constitution in respect of the obligations of the former State of Dholpur which came to be included in the State of Rajasthan. Dismissing the appeals, Held, that the new State by continuing the old laws without change till they were repealed or altered, recognised that it was liable in the same way as the merging State would have been in any case. Throughout the process of integration from 1948 to 1950, the new Sovereign must be taken to have recognised the rights of the subjects and undertaken the liabilities 175 of the old State. So under article 295(2) of the Constitution, the State of Rajasthan was liable to meet the liabilities of all old States which eventually were merged into it. Moreover, there was nothing to show that the right to claim the refund was taken away by any law competently passed. M/s Dalmia Dadri Cement Co.

The case concerns the constitutionality of the Madras Commercial Crops Markets Act, 1933, and its provisions regarding licensing and regulation of commercial crop trading. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**Background:**\n\n* The Act was enacted to regulate the buying and selling of commercial crops (cotton, groundnuts, and tobacco) in Madras.\n* The Act established markets, provided licensing requirements, and aimed to eliminate middlemen and ensure fair prices for growers.\n* The Act was challenged by traders who argued that the licensing provisions were unreasonable and hindered their ability to conduct business.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n* **Appellants' Arguments:**\n    * The licensing fees are too high, making it difficult for traders to operate profitably.\n    * The licensing restrictions prevent traders from buying and selling at competitive prices.\n    * The Act unfairly restricts small traders and forces them to travel long distances to sell their produce.\n    * The Act creates loopholes that allow large traders to operate with less restrictions.\n* **State's Arguments:**\n    * The licensing provisions are reasonable and necessary to achieve the Act's objectives of protecting growers and eliminating middlemen.\n    * The Act aims to create a fair and regulated market for commercial crops, and licensing is a necessary tool to achieve this.\n    * The Act provides for exemptions for small traders and ensures that the market is accessible to all.\n    * The Act is a comprehensive scheme that regulates the entire process of buying and selling commercial crops.\n\n**Court's Decision:**\n\n* The High Court upheld the constitutionality of the Act and its provisions.\n* The Court found that the licensing provisions were reasonable and necessary to achieve the Act's objectives.\n* The Court acknowledged the concerns of small traders but emphasized that the Act aims to create a fair market for all participants.\n* The Court noted that the Act provides for exemptions and mechanisms to address the concerns of small traders.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The case highlights the tension between individual rights and the need for government regulation in a market economy.\n* The Court balanced the interests of individual traders with the broader goal of ensuring a fair and efficient market for commercial crops.\n* The case demonstrates the importance of considering the overall scheme of a law when assessing its constitutionality.\n\n\n**Further Information:**\n\n* The full judgment is available in legal databases and may provide further details on the specific arguments and reasoning of the Court. \n* The case is relevant to understanding the legal framework for regulating commercial markets in India.",
        "reference": "The Madras legislature enacted the Madras Commercial Crops Markets Act for providing satisfactory conditions for the growers of commercial crops to sell their produce on equal terms with the purchasers and at reasonable prices. The Act, Rules and the Bye laws framed thereunder have a long term target of providing a net work of markets wherein facilities for correct weighment are ensured, storage accommodation is provided, and reliable market information is given. Till such markets are established the Act provides for the imposition of licensing restrictions to enable the buyers and sellers to meet in licensed premises. After the establishment of the markets no licenses would be issued within a reasonable radius from the markets and all growers will have to resort to the markets for selling their crops. The result would be to eliminate, as far as possible, the middlemen and to give reasonable facilities for the growers of commercial crops to secure best prices for their commodities. Held, that the impugned provisions of the Act impose reasonable restrictions on the citizen 's right to do business and are valid. Such a statute cannot be said to create unreasonable restrictions on the citizen 's right to do business unless it is clearly established that the provisions are too drastic, unnecessarily harsh and over reach the object for which they were made.

Five men, Pandurang, Tukia, Bhilia, Nilia, and the deceased's cousin, were accused of the crime.\n* **The Evidence:** The prosecution relied on eyewitness accounts of the assault, including the testimony of Rasika Bai and Subhana Rao, who witnessed the attack. The medical evidence showed that the victim died from a blow to the neck.\n* **The Defense:** The defense argued that the prosecution's evidence was weak and that the accused were not guilty. They argued that the eyewitnesses were unreliable and that there was no evidence of a pre-planned attack.\n\n**The Court's Decision:**\n\n* **Conviction:** The court upheld the convictions of Pandurang, Tukia, and Bhilia for murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. \n* **Nilia's Conviction:** The court found Nilia guilty of murder, but the court did not find him guilty of the same charge as the other three.\n* **Pandurang's Conviction:** The court found Pandurang not guilty of murder under Section 302. The court found that there was no evidence of a common intention to kill, and that Pandurang did not participate in the attack.\n* **Section 34:** The court found that there was no evidence of a common intention to kill, and that Pandurang did not participate in the attack.\n\n**Key Arguments:**\n\n* **Eyewitness Testimony:** The court found the eyewitness testimony of Rasika Bai and Subhana Rao to be credible, despite some inconsistencies in their accounts.\n* **Lack of Prior Concert:** The court found that there was no evidence of a pre-planned attack, and that the accused did not act in concert.\n* **Circumstantial Evidence:** The court found that the circumstantial evidence was insufficient to establish a common intention.\n* **Section 149:** The court dismissed the application of Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code, as there was no evidence of a common intention.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe court found that the prosecution had failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

        "reference": "It is well settled that common intention in section 34 of tile Indian Penal Code presupposes prior concert. It requires a prearranged plan because before a man can be vicariously convicted for the criminal act of another, the act must have boon done in furtherance of the common intention of them all. Accordingly there must have been a prior meeting of minds. Several persons can simultaneously attack a man and each can have the same intention, namely the intention to kill, and each can individually inflict a separate fatal blow and yet none would have the common intention required by the section because there was no prior meeting of minds to form a pre arranged plan. In a case like that, each would be individually liable for whatever injury he caused but none could be vicariously convicted for the act of any of the others; and if the prosecution cannot prove that his separate blow was a fatal one he cannot be convicted of the murder however clearly an intention to kill could be proved in his case. Care must be taken not to confuse same or similar intention with common intention; the partition which divides their bounds is often very thin, nevertheless the distinction is real and substantial, and if overlooked will result in miscarriage of justice. The plan need not be elaborate, nor is a long interval of time required. It could arise and be formed suddenly, But there must 139 1084 be pre arrangement and premeditated concert. It is not enough, to have the same intention independently of each other. The inference of common intention should never be reached unless it is a necessary inference deducible from the circumstances of the case. It is a question of fact in every case and however similar the circumstances, facts in one case cannot be used as a precedent to determine the conclusion on the facts in another. All that is necessary is either to have direct proof of prior concert, or proof of circumstances which necessarily lead to that inference, or, in other words, the incriminating facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of ex planation on any other reasonable hypothesis. When appellate judges, who agree on the question of guilt differ on that of sentence, it is usual not to impose the death penalty unless there are compelling reasons.

He relied on the Supreme Court's decision in *Tahiliani's case* (1980) which held that officiating government servants are not entitled to the post and cannot be considered in the same category as those holding substantive positions.\n* **Government's Argument:** The government argued that the petitioner was in a Class II service position and had entered service before the age of 35 years, making him eligible for compulsory retirement under Rule 56(j)(i). They also argued that the *Tahiliani's case* decision was correct and that the petitioner's officiating position did not grant him a right to the post.\n\n**Court's Decision:**\n\nThe Supreme Court disagreed with the government's argument and found in favor of the petitioner. The court held that:\n\n* **Rule 56(j) applies to all government servants in Class I or Class II service or post, regardless of whether they are holding a substantive or officiating position.** The court emphasized that the purpose of the rule is to provide the government with the power to compulsorily retire government servants in the public interest.\n* **The *Tahiliani's case* decision was incorrect.** The court found that the *Tahiliani's case* focused on the specific wording of the rule and did not consider the broader purpose of the rule.\n* **The petitioner is entitled to the salary and allowances he would have received had he not been compulsorily retired.** The court ordered the government to pay the petitioner the salary and allowances he would have received from November 5, 1976, to February 29, 1980.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* The Supreme Court allowed the writ petition and quashed the order of compulsory retirement.\n* The court also ordered the government to pay the petitioner the salary and allowances he would have received had he not been compulsorily retired.\n\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The court emphasized the importance of the purpose of the rule and its application to all government servants in Class I or Class II service or post.\n* The court rejected the government's argument that officiating positions do not qualify for the benefits of Rule 56(j).\n* The court recognized the petitioner's right to receive compensation for the period he was compulsorily retired. \n\n\nThis case highlights the importance of understanding the specific wording of legal rules and their intended purpose when interpreting their application.",
        "reference": "Fundamental Rule 56(j) confers power on the appropriate authority to compulsorily retire a Government servant, if it is in the public interest to do so, by giving 3 months ' notice or 3 months ' pay and allowances in lieu of such notice; while sub cl. (i) thereof states that a public servant in class I or class II service or post who had entered service before attaining the age of 35 years can be retired after he has attained the age of 50 years, sub cl. (ii) thereof states that any other public servant can be retired after he has attained the age of 55 years. In Union of India vs K.R. Tahiliani & Anr., this Court had held that F.R. 56(j) is meant to cover only those who are in a post on a regular basis, i.e., in a substantive capacity, and not on an officiating basis only. Basing his case on this decision, the petitioner, who had been compulsorily retired while working in a class II post In an officiating capacity, challenged the order of his compulsory retirement. Overruling the decision in Union of India vs K.R. Tahi liani & Anr., but, allowing the petition on the ground that the Delhi High Court, relying upon that decision, had grant ed relief to persons similarly placed as the petitioner, and, directing payment of his salary and allowances upto the date of his normal superannuation, HELD: Sub clause (1) of r. 56(j) of the Fundamental Rules applies to Government servants in Class I or Class II service or post on substantive, temporary or officiating basis. [638E F] There is no reference to officiating service in sub cl. The relevant words used in sub cl. (i) are \"if he is in CIasa I or CIasa II service or post. \" A person can be in Class I or CIasa II service or post even when he holds a post of either ciasa substantively or temporarily or on officiating basis. Instances are abundant where officers are promoted to CIasa I or Class II service or post of such class on officiating basis and 633 such officiation lasts for a number of years. Officiating promotion certainly does not confer a right to the post and at any time the Government servant may be sent back to his substantive post. There is, however, no reason why sub cl. (i) should be confined to service or post held on substan tive basis. It is not disputed that a person who is in Class I or Class II service or post is in such service or post as covered by sub cl. The possibility of such incumbent being sent back to the substantive post is not at all rele vant in the matter of exercising powers of compulsory re tirement. If the officiation is not brought to an end by reverting the Government servant to his substantive post before the power of compulsory retirement is exercised, the Government servant concerned must be taken to be in Class I or Class II service or post at the relevant time and would come within the ambit of sub cl. There is no warrant for the conclusion that officiating Government servants in Class I or Class II service or post are outside the purview of sub cl. The possibility of a reversion to the sub stantive post is not germane to the exercise of power con tained in F.R. 56. [637F H; 638A C] The purpose of F.R. 56(j) is to confer power on the appropriate authority to compulsorily retire a Government servant in the public interest and the classification of Government servants into two categories covered by sub cls. (i) and (ii) has a purpose behind it. If the condition indicated in sub cl. (i) is satisfied, namely, the Govern ment servant is in Class I or Class II service or post and he had entered into service before attaining the age of 35 years, and has attained the age of fifty, the further condi tion that he must substantively belong to the two classes of service or post cannot be introduced into the scheme. The purpose of the sub clauses is to classify Government serv ants into two categories and sub cl. (i) takes within its sweep those Government servants who at the relevant time are in Class I or Class II service or post, whether substantive ly, temporarily or on officiating basis.

He died before the policy was fully paid for. His widow, the plaintiff, sued the LIC for the full amount of the insurance.\n* **The LIC's Argument:** The LIC argued that the policy was not accepted, as the deceased did not receive the full premium and the Divisional Manager, the person authorized to accept the policy, did not explicitly accept it. \n* **The Plaintiff's Argument:** The plaintiff argued that the LIC's actions, including the receipt of the first premium and the preparation of the policy document, constituted acceptance of the policy.\n\n**The Trial Court's Decision:**\n\n* The trial court ruled in favor of the LIC, finding that the policy was not accepted because the Divisional Manager was the only person authorized to accept the policy, and the LIC's actions did not constitute acceptance.\n\n**The High Court's Decision:**\n\n* The High Court reversed the trial court's decision, finding that the LIC had accepted the policy. The High Court based its decision on the following:\n    * The LIC's actions, including the receipt of the first premium and the preparation of the policy document, constituted acceptance.\n    * The High Court found that the LIC's actions did not meet the legal requirements for acceptance, but the High Court's interpretation of the law was flawed.\n    * The High Court found that the LIC's actions did not constitute acceptance, as the Divisional Manager was the only person authorized to accept the policy.\n\n**The Appeal:**\n\n* The plaintiff appealed the High Court's decision.\n* The High Court reversed the trial court's decision and ordered the LIC to pay half of the amount received by the plaintiff.\n\n**Key Legal Issues:**\n\n* **Acceptance of Insurance Policy:** The case centers around the legal definition of \"acceptance\" in insurance contracts. The High Court's interpretation of the law was flawed, and the case highlights the importance of clear communication and evidence of acceptance in insurance contracts.\n* **Authority to Accept:** The case also raises questions about the authority of different officers within an insurance company to accept a policy.\n\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* The appeal was allowed, and the High Court ordered the LIC to pay half of the amount received by the plaintiff. \n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis case highlights the importance of clear communication and evidence of acceptance in insurance contracts.

        "reference": "One Late Raja Vasireddi Chandra Dhara Prasad died intestate on 12th January, 1961. He had filled a proposal for insurance for Rs. 50,000 on 27th December 1960. There was medical examination by the doctor on the life of the deceased on 27th, December, 1960. The deceased issued two cheques being the consideration towards the first premium for Rs 300 and Rs. 220 respectively which were encashed by the appellant on 29th December 1960 and 11th January 1961. On 16th January 1961, the widow of the deceased wrote to the appellant intimating the death of the deceased and demanded payment of Rs. 50,000 The Divisional Manager, Masulipatam Branch denied liability on behalf of the appellant on 28th January, 1961. Thereafter there was correspondence between the parties between Ist February 1961 and 23rd December 1963. On 10th January 1964, the respondents filed a suit in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Masulipatam. The trial court dismissed the suit holding, inter alia, that there was no concluded contract, that the proposal was not accepted by the Divisional Manager for some reason or the other by the time the deceased had died, that neither the encashment of the two cheques created a contract of insurance. In appeal, the High Court after ordering certain other additional documents set aside the Trial Court Judgment. Hence the appeal by the Corporation after obtaining the special leave. Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD; 1. Having regard to the clear position in law about acceptance of insurance proposal and the evidence of record in this case, it is clear that the, High Court was in error. in coming to the conclusion that there was a concluded contract of insurance between the deceased and the Life Insurance Corporation. [360D E] 2. Though in certain human relationship silence to a proposal might 351 convey acceptance but in the case of insurance proposal, silence does not denote consent and no binding contract arises until the person to whom an offer is made says or does something to signify his acceptance. Mere delay in giving an answer cannot be construed as an acceptance, as, prima facie, acceptance must be communicated to the offer or The general rule is that the contract of insurance will be concluded only when the party to whom an offer has been made accepts it unconditionally and communicates his acceptance to the person making the offer. Whether the final acceptance is that of the assured or insurers, however, depend simply on the way in which negotiations for an insurance have progressed. [359H, 360A B] 3: 1. When an insurance policy becomes effective is well settled by the authorities but it is clear that the expression \"underwrite\" signifies accept liability under that. The dictionary meaning also indicates that. It is true that normally the expression \"underwrite\" is used in Marine insurance but the expression used in Chapter III of the Financial Powers of the Standing order in this case specifically used the expression 'funderwriting and revivals\" of policies in case of Life Insurance Corporation and stated that it was the Divisional Manager who was competent to underwrite policy for Rs, 50,000 and above. [359 B D] 3: 2. The mere receipt and retention of premium until after the death of the applicant or the mere preparation of the policy document is not acceptance. Acceptance must be signified by some acts or acts agreed on by the parties or from which the law raised a presumption of acceptance. [359D E] 3: 3 In the instant case, the High Court was in error in coming to the following conclusions; (i) that there was not sufficient pleading that there was no concluded contract, and non acceptance of the proposal was not sufficient averment that the Divisional Manager was the only competent authority to accept the proposal; (ii) in its view about the powers of the different authorities under Chapter III of the Standing order 1960, dealing with the financial powers; (iii) about the view that the Assistant Divisional Manager having accepted the proposal and (iv) about the assurance given by the Field officers that the acceptance of the first premium would automatically create a concluded contract of insurance ' [358E H] The Court however directed half the amount of the insurance amount of Rs. 85,000 paid to the Respondents to be refunded to the Corporation.

        "reference": "M/s Tarapore & Co. who were plaintiffs in a suit applied for an interim injunction restraining the first defendant in the suit from taking any steps in pursuance of a letter of credit opened in favour of the second defendant. A single judge of the High Court granted an interim injunction restraining encashment of the letters of credit pending disposal of the suit. In appeals under the Letters Patent preferred by the second dependent, the High Court of Madras set aside that order. Against the orders passed in the two appeals, the plaintiffs applied for certificate under articles 133(1) (a) and 133(1)(b) of the Constitution. The High Court observed that an order granting interim injunction \"is a final order, as far as this Court is concerned, determining the rights of parties within this his or proceeding, which is independent though ancillary to the suit\", and they were competent to grant certificate. In this Court the defendants applied for revocation of the certificate. HELD: The certificate must be revoked. An order passed by the, High Court in appeal which does not finally dispose of a suit or proceeding and leaves the rights and obligations of the parties for determination in the suit or proceeding from which the appeal has arisen, is not final within the meaning of article 133(1)(a) and (h). The order refusing to grant an interim injunction did not determine the rights and obligations of the parties in relation to the matter in dispute in the suit. It could not be held that because the plaintiffs suit as a result of the order of the High Court may become infructuous as framed and the plaintiff may have to amend his plaint to obtain effective relief an order which is essentially an interlocutory order may be deemed final for the purpose of article 133(1) of the Constitution.

This is referred to as the \"deemed factory gate.\"\n* **Trader's Declaration:** If the trader who entrusts the fabric for processing provides a declaration of the selling price at which they intend to sell the processed goods, the excise authorities will use that price as the assessable value. This declaration must only include the price or deemed price at which the processed fabric leaves the processor's factory, plus the trader's profit.\n* **Rule 174 of the Central Excise Rules:** This rule mandates that when goods are manufactured by one person and sold by another, the price at which the manufacturer sells the goods is required. This price must include the value of the grey cloth or fabric, the job work done, and the manufacturing profit and expenses. \n* **Excise Duty Calculation:** The court clarified that the processor's expenses, costs, and charges, along with their profit, must be included in the assessable value. However, the trader's profit, which is earned after the processing, is not included.\n\n**In essence, the court established a clear framework for determining the assessable value of processed fabric for excise duty purposes, emphasizing the importance of considering the cost of processing, the trader's profit, and the \"deemed factory gate\" principle.**",
        "reference": "On a civil miscellaneous petition for clarification of this Court 's judgment dated 4th November, 1988, the Court. HELD: The assessable value of the processed fabric would be the value of the grey cloth in the hands of the processor plus the value of the job work done plus manufacturing profit and manufacturing expenses whatever these may be, which will either be included in the price at the factory gate or deemed to be the price at the factory gate for the processed fabric. [345D E] The factory gate means the \"deemed\" factory gate as if the processed fabric was sold by the processor. [345E] If the trader. who entrusts cotton or man made fabric to the processor for processing on job work basis, would give a declaration to the processor as to what would be the price at which he would be selling the processed goods in the market, that would be taken by the Excise authorities as the assessable value of the processed fabric and excise duty would be charged to the processor on that basis. Such a declaration would include only the price or deemed price at which the processed fabric would leave the processor 's factory plus his profit. It is necessary to include the processor 's expenses, costs and charges plus profit, but not the trader 's profits who gets the fabrics processed, because those would be post manufacturing profits.

Jain, who was appointed as a clerk by a local Panchayat Samiti (a local government body) in 1963.  The employee was later promoted to Head Clerk, but the law was amended in 1973, removing the Panchayat Samiti's power to make appointments.\n* **The Amendment:** The Punjab Panchayat Samitis, Zilla Parishads (Haryana Amendment) Act of 1973 removed the power of the Panchayat Samiti to make appointments.\n* **The Employee's Argument:** Jain argued that he was entitled to continue in service as a Head Clerk because of a provision in the 1973 amendment that allowed employees who were already working for the Samiti before the amendment to continue in service on the same terms and conditions.\n\n**The Court's Decision:**\n\n* **The Court's Reasoning:** The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the respondent (the government) and dismissed the appeal. The court found that:\n    * **The amendment removed the Panchayat Samiti's power to make appointments.** This meant that the Samiti could no longer appoint anyone to the Head Clerk position, even if they had previously been promoted.\n    * **The appointments made after the amendment were invalid.** The court emphasized that the appointment of Jain as Head Clerk after June 13, 1973, was made without the authority of law.\n    * **The employee's promotion was not a guarantee of continued employment.** The court stated that the promotion was made after the amendment, and therefore, did not override the law.\n    * **The government was not obligated to absorb the employee into a higher position.** The court concluded that the government was not obligated to absorb Jain into the Head Clerk position because the appointment was made without legal authority.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **The amendment to the law significantly changed the power dynamics between the local government bodies and the employees.**\n* **The court emphasized the importance of following the law and the limitations of the amendment.**\n* **The case highlights the importance of understanding the legal implications of amendments to local government laws.**\n\n\nThis case is a good example of how legal changes can impact employment rights and the need for employees to understand the legal framework within which they work.",
        "reference": "Section 33 of the Punjab Panchayat Samitis and Zilla Parishads Act, 1961 provided that subject to rules made by the Government, a Panchayat Samiti may employ such servants as it may consider necessary for the efficient performance of the duties imposed upon it by the Act, rules or bye laws made thereunder or by any other law for the time being in force. The Punjab Panchayat Samitis and Zilla Parishads (Haryana Amendment Act, 1973 which came into force from June, 13, 1973, introduced extensive amendments. Section 33 of the Act was deleted by Section 13 of the Amending Act, Sub section (4) of Section 14 the Amending Act, provided that persons employed by a Panchayat Samiti before April 4, 1973 and who were in service at the commencement of the Amending Act, \"shall continue to serve on the same terms and conditions on which they were employed by the Panchayat Samiti\" until they are absorbed in the Government Service or retire in such manner as may be prescribed. Section 35(1) of the Act empowers the State Government to place at the disposal of a Panchayat Samiti such of its servants as are required for the implementation of the schemes annexed therewith, and for such other duties and functions as may be assigned to them by the Panchayat Samitis from time to time. The appellant was appointed as a clerk on June 1, 1963 by the Panchayat Samiti, Loharu. He was confirmed in that post ill course of time. On January 21, 1974, he was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis. On March, 14 1975 a resolution was passed by the Samiti regularising the post of Head Clerk. On April 1, 1975, the appellant was appointed as a Head Clerk. Acting in pursuance of the provision of Section 14(1) of the. the Amending Act, The Government of Haryana notified the absorption of the appellant as a clerk, though he was working as a Head Clerk since January 21, 1974. Being aggrieved the appellant filed a Writ Petition and prayed for a direction to absorb him as a Head Clerk. The Writ Petition having been dismissed by the High Court, the appellant has filed this appeal by special leave. Dismissing the appeal, the Court, ^ HELD: 1.1. The Panchayat Samiti had no right to appoint the appellant to the post of Head Clerk on the date on which it purported to do so. As a result of the deletion of Section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973, the 735 Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointment to the Panchayat. It could not therefore have appointed the appellant as a Head Clerk, as it purported to do so, in January, 1974 on an adhoc basis or in April 1965 on a regular basis. [737D] 1.2. Though the right to be considered for promotion is a term and condition of service, in the instant case, the appointment of the appellant to the post of a Head Clerk being without the authority of law, the Government was not bound to absorb him in the post of a Head Clerk.

        "reference": "The plaintiffs in their suit claimed that the properties in dispute belonged to the Math Sauna temple and that one of the plaintiffs Mahant Sadashiva Yati on the death of his predecessor was elected as Mahant of the temple and that therefore as Sarbarakar he was entitled to all the properties recorded in the name of the deity or his predecessor. The defendant claimed that by virtue of a will executed by Mahant Shivshankar Yati, the predecessor Mahant, the properties in dispute which were his personal properties devolved on him. The Civil Judge decreed the plaintiffs ' suit with a finding that Mahant Sadashiv Yati was not the Sarbarakar. Upholding the respondent 's claim, the High Court in appeal, held that the properties did not belong either to the Math or the deity but were the personal and separate properties of Mahant Shivshankar Yati. In appeal to this Court the appellants impugned the correctness of the High Court 's view. Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: The properties in dispute did not form part of the properties of Math Sauna or of the deity but were the personal properties of the respondent. [664 D E] It is well accepted that certain sects of Sanyasis (such as Dashnami Sanyasis in this case) could acquire personal property of their own and that the pronamis given to a Mahant are generally his personal property. The mere fact that a Mahant is an ascetic does not raise any presumption that the property in his possession is not his personal property. There is no presumption either way. In each case the burden is upon the plaintiff to establish that the properties in respect of which he is asking for possession are properties to which he is entitled. [662 F G] 660 In the instant case the three earlier Mahants before they took to sanyasa had been grahasthas. They were entitled to possess, enjoy and acquire personal property. Mahant Shivpher Yati, one of the predecessor Mahants, whose reputation as a man of learning and personal attainments was high, received personal bhents from many of his affluent chelas. In addition, on the death of his predecessor Mahant Shivbaran Yati. Mahant Shivpher Yati inherited his personal property, all of which devolved on Shivshankar Yati. A succession certificate in respect of these properties was granted in the name of Shivshankar Yati. The revenue records also showed him as the owner of the properties and not the Math or the deity. None of the transfers of small parcels of these properties made by Mahant Shivshankar Yati from time to time was challenged by the plaintiffs at any time. [663 A l] Whether a property was acquired by the application of the nucleus could only be determined after taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of a case and on a balancing of the entire evidence. The burden of proof rests on the party making the claim. [663 F G] In the present case there is no material on record to how whether the total income from the properties belonging to the Math and the deity, left any appreciable surplus after meeting the expenditure on bhog and other ceremonies. The High Court rightly held that the fund from which the properties were acquired constituted the personal property of Mahant Shivpher Yati on whose death Shivshankar Yati employed it for the purchase of the properties and by virtue of his will the properties devolved on the respondent.

The case concerns a dispute over the management of a religious institution, the Shiromani Nirankari Dera, and the right to manage its properties.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of the key points:**\n\n**The Case:**\n\n* **Plaintiff:** The appellant, claiming to be the rightful mahant (manager) of the Shiromani Nirankari Dera at Landeke, filed a suit seeking possession of the Dera and its properties.\n* **Defendant:** Som Dass, the previous mahant, claimed to be lawfully appointed and was in possession of the Dera's properties.\n* **Death of Som Dass:** Som Dass died before the appeal was heard. The appellant did not promptly implead his successor, Shiam Dass, as the new mahant.\n* **Abatement of the Appeal:** The High Court held that the appeal had abated (ceased) because the appellant did not bring Shiam Dass on record within the prescribed time.\n\n**The Appeal:**\n\n* **Appellant's Argument:** The appellant argued that Shiam Dass, as the elected successor, should have been brought on record, and that the appeal should not be dismissed due to the delay in impleading him.\n* **High Court's Decision:** The High Court disagreed, stating that the devolution of interest in the subject matter of the suit (the Dera and its properties) did not occur until Shiam Dass was elected as the new mahant. They held that the appeal had abated because the appellant did not bring Shiam Dass on record within the prescribed time.\n\n**Supreme Court's Decision:**\n\n* **Reversal of the High Court's Decision:** The Supreme Court reversed the High Court's decision, finding that the devolution of interest in the subject matter of the suit occurred upon Som Dass's death and Shiam Dass's election as the new mahant.\n* **Application of Order 22, Rule 10:** The Supreme Court emphasized that Order 22, Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code allows for the continuation of a suit when an interest in the subject matter of the suit has devolved during the pendency of the suit. This rule applies even if the devolution occurs due to death or other reasons.\n* **Shiam Dass as Representative:** The Supreme Court found that Shiam Dass was acting in a representative capacity as the successor to Som Dass, and therefore, he could be added as a party under Order 22, Rule 10.\n* **Allowing the Appeal:** The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and directed the High Court to dispose of the appeal on its merits.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of the appellant, finding that the High Court erred in dismissing the appeal based on the delay in impleading Shiam Dass. The court emphasized the importance of Order 22, Rule 10 in allowing the continuation of a suit when an interest in the subject matter of the suit has devolved during the pendency of the suit. \n\n\nThis case highlights the importance of understanding the legal principles surrounding devolution of interest in a suit and the application of Order 22, Rule 10 in such situations.",
        "reference": "The appellant filed the suit on the basis that as the Mahant of a Dera he was entitled to possession and management of the properties of its branch Dera. The defendant contended that it was an independent Dera and that he was in possession of the properties as its lawfully appointed Mahant. The trial court decreed the suit but in appeal the decree was reversed. While the second appeal, preferred by the appellant, was pending in the High Court, the defendant died. As the application to implead the elected successor of the defendant was filed beyond the period prescribed for an application under O. 23, rr. 3 and 4, the High Court held that the appeal had abated and that there was no ground for setting aside the abatement. In appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that even if the Chela, who had been elected as the Mahant on the death of the defendant, was not impleaded within the period prescribed, there would be no abatement, because he represented the Dera. Allowing the appeal to this Court, ^ HELD: (1) When a suit is brought by or against a person in a representative capacity and there is a devolution of the interest of the representative, the rule that has to be applied is O. 22, r. 10 and not O. 22, rr. 3 or 4, whether the devolution takes place as a consequence of death or for any other reason. The word 'interest ' in the rule means interest in the property, i.e., the subject matter of the suit, and the interest is the interest of the person who was the party to the suit. This rule is based on the principle that the trial of a suit cannot be brought to an end merely because the interest of a party in the subject matter of the suit has devolved upon another during the pendency of the suit. The suit may be continued against the person acquiring the interest with the leave of the Court. [489F G] In the present case, when the defendant died, the interest which was the subject matter of the suit devolved upon his successor elected as the Mahant of the Dera, and therefore, the appeal could be continued under O. 22 r. 10, C.P.C. [489B C] (2) Though it was uncertain on the death of the defendant as to who would become the Mahant by election, it would not make any difference for the application of O. 22, r. 10. The devolution of the interest in the subject matter of the suit took place when the new Mahant was elected. The suit was for possession and management of the Dera and the properties appertaining to it by the appellant purporting to be the de jure Mahant against the defendant as a de facto Mahant. The subject matter of the suit was the interest of the defendant in the Dera and its properties and it devolved upon the new Mahant by virtue of his election subsequent to the death of the defendant. As it was in a representative capacity that he defendant was sued and that it was in the same representative capacity that the appeal was sought to be continued against the new Mahant, O. 23, r. 10 will apply.

        "reference": "A new political party called Telugu Desam swept to power in the 1983 Andhra Pradesh Assembly elections, within a month of assuming office, the new Government of Andhra Pradesh, passed an order No. G.O.M.S. 36 GAD Services dated 8.2.83 (appending two Notifications) stating that in order to provide greater employment opportunities to the youths it had decided to reduce the age of superannuation of all Government employees, other than those in the last grade service, from 58 to 55 years with elect from February 28, 1983. Over 18,000 employees and 10,000 public sector employees were superannuated, as a result of the order. The aggreived employees, therefore filed writ petitions and challenged the constitutional validity of the said order and Notifications under Articles 14, 16, 21 and 300A of the Constitution. According to the petitioners: (i) there was no basis at all for reducing the age of retirement from 58 to 55, as nothing had happened since October 29,1979 on which date the age limit was raised from 55 to 58 years; (ii) providing employment opportunities to the youths has no relevance on the question of fixing the age of retirement; (iii) the government had exercised its power arbitrarily without having regard to factors which are relevant on the fixation of the age of retirement; (iv) the government had acted unreasonably in not giving any previous notice to the employees which would have enabled them to arrange their affairs on the eve of retirement; (v) the government was estopped from reducing the age of retirement to 55 since the employees had acted on the representations made to them in 1979 by increasing the age of retirement from 55 to 58; (vi) as a result of the increase in the age of retirement from 55 to 58 years in 1979, a vested right had accrued to the 580 employees. which could be taken away if at all, only from future entrants to the government service; (vii) retirement of experienced and mature persons from government service will result in grave detriment to public services of the State (viii) the decision of the government is bad for a total non application of the mind to the relevant facts and circumstances bearing on the question of age of retirement like increased longevity; and (ix) the government had not even considered the enormous delay which would be caused in the payment of pensionary benefits to employees who were retired from service without any pre thought. The respondent State filed two affidavits traverssing each and every ground of challenge and asserted that the age of retirement was reduced because \"it is the duty of the State, within the limits of its economic capacity and development to make effective provisions to solve the unemployment problem which has gone upto 17,84,699 by December 31, 1 982. The contentions of the State were: (i) the question of the age of superannuation was not referred to the One man Pay Commission and therefore, its recommendations to increase the age from 55 to 58 was only casual not based on relevant criteria and has no relevance to the present decision of the State to reduce the age of retirement; (ii) as a result of the unwarranted increase in the age of superannuation from 55 to 58 not only was there a one third increase in the number of unemployed youths but also the chances of promotion of the service personnel had deteriorated resulting in wide spread frustration and unemployment: (iii) the age of retirement was reduced because it is the duty of the State, within its limits of economic capacity and development, to make effective provision to solve the unemployment problem; (iv) the fact that the average expectation of life is about 70 years is not a ground for increasing the age of retirement of Government employees; (v) the general trend was for reducing the age of retirement; (vi) the Government of Kerala and Karnataka had reduced the age of retirement of their employees to 55 and in some other States in India also the age of retirement is 55, (vii) the present decision was taken by the Government in order to fulfill its commitment that it will make welfare measures in order to improve the lot of the common man, and particularly, in order to afford opportunity to qualified and talented unemployed youths whose number was increasing enormously due to expansion of educational facilities; (viii) the present measure was intended to have a salutory effect on the creation of incentives to the deserving employees; and (ix) the question as regards the age of retirement is a pure question of governmental policy affording no cause of action to the petitioners to file the writ petitions. Rule Nisi was issued on the writ petitions by the court on February 25,1983. The Legislative Assembly of Andhra Pradesh was prorogued on April 9, 1983. On the very next day, i.e. April 10, 1983 the Governor promulgated Ordinance No. 5 of 1983 called the Andhra Pradesh Public Employment (Regulation of conditions of Service) Ordinance, 1983 by which proviso to Rule 2 and Rule 56 of the Andhra Pradesh Fundamental Rules and Rule 231 of the Hyderabad Civil Service Rules the rule governing the age of retirement were omitted. Dismissing the petitions, the Court ^ HELD: 1.1 Public interest demands that there ought to be an age of retirement in public services. The poin of the peak level of efficiency is bound to differ 581 from individual to individual for that reason. A common scheme of general application governing superannuation has, therefore, to be evolved in the light of experience regarding performance levels of employees, the need to provide employment opportunities to the younger sections of society and the need to open up promotional opportunities to employees at the lower levels early in their career. Inevitably, the public administrator has to counterbalance conflicting claims while determining the age of superannuation. On the one hand, public services cannot be deprived of the benefit of the mature experience of senior employees; on the other hand, a sense of frustration and stagnation cannot be allowed to generate in the minds of the junior members of the services and the younger sections of the society. The balancing of these conflicting claims of the different segments of society involves minute questions of policy and considerations of varying vigour and applicability which must, as far as possible, be left to the judgment of the executive and the legislature. [ 90F H; 591A B] E.P. Royappa vs State of Tamil Nadu, ; referred to. 1.2 While resolving the validity of policy issues like the age of retirement, it is not proper for the Court to put the conflicting claims in a sensitive judicial scale and decide the issue by finding out which way the balance tilts. That s an exercise which the administrator and the legislature have to undertake. This is so because often, the Court has no satisfactory and effective means to decide which alternative, out of the many competing ones, is the best in the circumstances of a given case. [591E; C] 1.3 It is not that every question of policy is out side the scope of judicial review or that necessarily, there are no manageable standards for reviewing any and every question of policy. If the age of retirement is fixed at an unreasonably low level so as to make it arbitrary and irrational, the Court 's interference would be called for though not for fixing the age of retirement but for mandating a closer consideration, of the matter. [591C D] 2. Fixing the age of superannuation by reducing it from 58 to 55 would be unreasonable or arbitrary if it does not accord with the principles which are relevant for fixing the age of retirement or if it does not subserve any public interest. On the other hand, the Ordinance shall have to be held valid, if the fundamental premise upon which it proceeds has been accepted as fair and reasonable in comparable situations, if its provisions bear nexus with public interest and if it does not offend against the Constitutional limitations either on legislative competence or on the legislative power to pass laws which bear on fundamental rights. [591G H: 592A] 3.1 The report of the One man Pay Commission has to be kept out of consideration in so far as the question of the age of retirement is concerned. The contention that the reversal of the well considered decision of the Commission to raise the age to 58 within a short span of less than three years and a half, as nothing had happened in between warranting a departure from it, is fallacious because the question, as to whether the age of retirement should be raised which was then 55, was not referred to the Commission at all in the terms of reference. Further the decision which the Government took later to increase the age of retirement from 55 to 58 years was not based on the recommendation of the Commission. [595D; C] 582 3.2 The Power of a Commission to inquire into a question must depend upon the terms of the reference and not upon the statements made on the floor of the House. [595A] 3.3 A review of retirement benefits would undoubtedly cover the examination of the rules or schemes relating to pension, provident fund, gratuity, encasement of leave etc., but it cannot include the power to examine the question as regards the fixation of the age of retirement. Therefore, paragraph 9 47 of the report of One man Pay Commission which begins by saying that \"since the terms of reference of the Commission cover the review of the existing retirement benefits, the reference would naturally include the age of retirement\" was an erroneous and unwarranted reading of the terms of the reference. [594F; E] 4.1 No law can be said to be bad because it is passed immediately on the assumption of office by a new Government. Were this so, every decision taken by a new Government soon after assumption of office shall have to be regarded as arbitrary. I 595E] 4.2 The reasonableness of a decision in any jurisdiction, does not depend upon the time which it takes. A delayed decision of the Executive can also be bad as offending against the provisions of the Constitution and it can be no defence to the charge of unconstitutionality that the decision was taken after the lapse of a long time. Conversely, decisions which arc taken promptly cannot be assumed to be bad because they arc taken promptly. [595F G] 4.3 Every decision has to be examined on its own merits, in order to determine whether it is arbitrary or unreasonable. Here, the State Government had the relevant facts as also the reports of the various Central and State Pay Commissions before it, 011 the basis of which it had taken a reasonable decision to reduce the age of retirement from 58 to 55. The aid and assistance of a well trained bureaucracy which notoriously, plays an important part not only in the implementation of policies but in their making was also available to the Government. Therefore, the speed with which the decision was taken cannot, without more, invalidate it on the ground of arbitrariness. [59 G; 596.A B] 5.1 By and large, in the formulation of matters of legislative policy, the government of the day must be allowed a free, though fair play and there need not necessarily be a uniform age of retirement all over India. Though immutable considerations which are generally or universally true like increased life expectation are as much valid for Jammu and Kashmir as for Tamil Nadu, that cannot justify the conclusion that fixation of the retirement age at 55 in Jammu and Kashmir is invalid since the State of Tamil Nadu has fixed it at 58 or that the age limit should be fixed at 62 or 65. There is no one fixed or focal point of reasonableness. There can be a large and wide area within which the administrator or the legislator can act, without violating the constitutional mandate of reasonableness. That is the area which permits free play in the joints. [596C D; F] 5.2 The area between the ages of 55 and 58 is regarded in our country as a permissible field of operation for fixing the are of retirement. Neither the American nor the English notions or norms for fixing the retirement age can render invalid the basis which is widely accepted in our country as reasonable for that purpose. [597D E] 5.3 On the basis of the data furnished in the White Paper presented to the State Legislative Assembly in March 1983 on the question of \"reduction in 583 the age of superannuation from 58 years to 55 years\" by the new Telugu Desam Party controlled State Government, the reduction of the age of retirement from 58 to 55, in the instant case is not hit by Article 14 or 16 of the Constitution and the State Government or the Legislature has not acted arbitrarily or irrationally. The precedents within our country itself for fixing the retirement age at 55 or for reducing it from 58 to 55 and their acceptance depending upon the employment policy of the Government of the day make it impossible to lay down an inflexible rule that 58 years is a reasonable age for retirement and 55 is not. If the policy adopted for the time being by the Government or the Legislature is shown to violate recognized norms of employment planning, it would be possible to say that the policy is irrational since, in that event, it would not bear reasonable nexus with the object which it seeks to achieve. The reports of the various Commissions show that the creation of new avenues of employment for the youth is an integral part of any policy governing the fixation of retirement age. Here, the impugned policy is actuated and influenced predominantly by that consideration. [604C F] However, the question of age of retirement should always be examined by the Government with more than ordinary care, more than the State Government has bestowed upon it in this case. The fixation. Of age of retirement has minute and multifarious dimensions which shape the lives of citizens. Therefore, it is vital from the point of view of their well being that the question should be considered with the greatest objectivity and decided upon the basis of empirical data furnished by scientific investigation. What is vital f`or the welfare of the citizens is, of necessity, vital for the survival or the State. Care must also be taken to ensure that the statistics are not perverted to serve a malevolent purpose. [604F H ] 6. It is well settled that Article 311(2) of the Constitution is attracted only when a civil servant is reduced in rank, dismissed or removed from service by way of penalty, that is to say, when the effect of the order passed against him in his behalf is to visit him with evil consequences. The termination of service of an employer on account of his reaching the age of superannuation does not amount to his removal from service within the meaning of Article 311(2). Here there being no arbitrariness in the fixation of reduced retirement age, there is no violation of Article 311(2) of the Constitution, either.

Though an ordinance can be invalidated for contravention of the constitutional limitations which exist upon the power of the State legislature to pass laws it cannot be declared invalid for the reason of non application of mind, any more than any other law call be. An executive act is liable to be struck 584 down on the ground of non application of mind. Not the act of a Legislature. The power to issue an ordinance is no an executive power but is the power of the executive to legislate. The power of the Governor to promulgate an ordinance is contained in Article 213 which occurs in Chapter IV of Part VI of the Constitution. The heading of that Chapter is \"Legislative Power of the Governor\". This power is plenary within. its field like the power of the State Legislature to pass laws and there are no limitations upon that power except those to which the legislative power of the State Legislature is subject.

If a rule of retirement can be deemed to deprive a person of his right to livelihood, it will be impermissible to provide for an age of retirement at all. That will be contrary to public interest because the Slate cannot afford the luxury of allowing Its employees o continue in service after they have passed the point of peak performance. Rules of retirement do not take away the right of a person to his livelihood: they limit his right to hold office to a stated number of years. [608D E] 9.1 The burden to establish mala fides is a heavy burden to discharge. Vague and casual allegations suggesting that a certain act was done with an ulterior motive cannot be accepted without proper pleadings and adequate proof, both of which are conspicuously absent in these writ petitions. Besides the ordinance making power being a legislative power, the argument of mala fides is misconceived. The legislature, as a body, cannot be accused of having passed a law for an extraneous purpose. If no reasons are so stated as appear from the provisions enacted by it. Its reasons for passing a law or those that are stated in the Objects and Reasons. Even assuming that the executive, in a given case, has an ulterior motive in moving a legislation, that motive cannot render the passing of the law mala fide. This kind of 'transferred malice ' is unknown in the field of legislation. [608G H; 609A B] 9.2 The amendment made to the Fundamental Rules in the exercise of power conferred by Articles 309 by which the proviso to Rule 2 was deleted reirospectively, with effect from February 23, 1983 by G.O.M.S. dated P 17 2 83 was a valid exercise of legislative power. The rules and amendments made under the proviso to Article 309 can be altered or repealed by the Legislature but until that is done the exercise of the power cannot be challenged as lacking in authority. [610B C] 9.3 It is well settled that the service rules can be as much amended, as they can be mader, under the proviso to Article 309 and that, the power to amend these rules carries with it the power to amend them retrospectively. The power conferred by the proviso to Article 309 is of a legislative character and is to be distinguished from an ordinary rule making power. The power to legislate is of a plenary nature within the field demarcated by the Constitution and it includes the power to legislate retrospectively. [609H; 610A B] B.s.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**The Issue:**\n\nThe case revolves around the interpretation of Section 9(1) of the Haryana Sales Tax Act, 1973. This section deals with the tax liability of registered dealers who purchase goods without paying tax, but use them to manufacture goods for export. The appellants (the assessee) claim they are not liable to pay tax because they purchased raw materials, manufactured goods, and exported them, all within the framework of the Act. The respondent (the tax authority) disagrees, arguing that the purchase of raw materials without paying tax is a taxable event.\n\n**Key Legal Provisions:**\n\n* **Section 9(1):** This section outlines the tax liability of registered dealers who purchase goods without paying tax, but use them to manufacture goods for export.\n* **Section 5(1):** This section defines when a sale or purchase of goods is considered to be in the course of export. It requires the sale or purchase to either cause the export or be followed by a transfer of documents of title after the goods cross the customs frontiers of India.\n* **Section 5(3):** This section, added by the Haryana Sales Tax (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1976, clarifies that the last sale or purchase of goods preceding the export of those goods is also considered to be in the course of export if it was made for the purpose of complying with the export agreement or order.\n* **Section 24:** This section outlines the rights of registered dealers to purchase goods without paying tax under certain conditions.\n* **Section 27:** This section defines \"taxable turnover\" and its relevant provisions.\n\n**The Arguments:**\n\n* **Assessee's Argument:** They claim they are not liable to pay tax because they purchased raw materials, manufactured goods, and exported them, all within the framework of the Act.\n* **Respondent's Argument:** They argue that the purchase of raw materials without paying tax is a taxable event.\n\n**The Court's Decision:**\n\nThe court will likely need to determine the following:\n\n* **The interpretation of Section 9(1):** Does it apply to the purchase of raw materials without paying tax?\n* **The application of Section 5(1):** Does the sale of goods to an export canalising agency or an export house qualify as a sale in the course of export?\n* **The impact of Section 5(3):** Does the last sale or purchase of goods preceding the export of those goods qualify as in the course of export?\n\n**The Significance:**\n\nThis case is significant because it deals with the interpretation of a key tax provision in a state with a complex export-oriented economy. The court's decision will have implications for businesses involved in the manufacturing and export of goods in Haryana.\n\n\n**Further Notes:**\n\n* The document provides a detailed legal analysis of the relevant provisions of the Haryana Sales Tax Act, 1973.\n* The document also includes a summary of the arguments and precedents relevant to the case.\n* The document is likely to be used as a basis for the court's decision.",
        "reference": "Each of the appellants/petitioners is a registered dealer in the State of Haryana. He purchased certain raw materials in the State without paying purchase tax thereon, in view of the provision contained in section 24 of the Haryana Sales Tax Act, 1973. He manufactured certain goods in the State with the aid of the said raw materials. He then sold the manufactured goods to dealers who, in turn, export ed those goods out of India. On these facts the assessee claimed that he was not liable to pay the purchase tax on the raw materials, imposed under section 9(1) of the Sales Tax Act. The Department denied the relief on the short ground that the sales effected by the appellants were not sales in the course of export outside India within the meaning of section 5(1) of the . Ac cording to the Department, they were only \"penultimate\" sales, which may be deemed to be 'export sales ' because of the fiction created under section 5(3) of the C.S. Act 1956, but that was not enough to escape from the clutches of the charge in section 9(1). Accordingly, the claim of the asses see was rejected by the taxing authorities. The High Court also rejected the assessee 's petition. Before this Court, it was contended on behalf of the assessees that the effect of section 5(3) of the C.S.T. Act was to expand the scope of section 5(1) and include within the concept of sales in the course of export outside India also the 'penultimate ' sales; that a reference to, and the meaning of, section 5(1) could not be understood without a reference to section 5(3); and that as a result of section 5(3), such penultimate sales became export sales falling beyond the purview and competence of State legislature. It was further submitted that purchases of 344 raw material used in the manufacture of goods inside the State attracted the tax under section 9(1) unless those manufactured goods were dealt with in one of three ways; (1) disposed of by way of sale inside the State; (2) despatched to a place outside the State but by way of a sale in the course of inter State trade or commerce; or (3) despatched to a place outside the State but by way of sale in the course of export outside the territory of India. In the alternative, it was contended that as the asses see had sold goods to other parties in India, those sales must be either local sales or inter state sales; and that in any view of the matter, it would be a sale covered by the exceptions in section 9(1), and the assessee 's purchases of raw material would not attract tax under section 9(1). On the other hand, on behalf of the State it was, inter alia contended that there were no facts on record to sub stantiate the claim on behalf of the assessee that the sales in question fulfilled the conditions set out in section 5(3) of the C.S.T. Act. It was submitted that the assessees would be entitled to an exemption from the impugned purchase tax only if their sales were export Sales within the meaning of section 5(1) of the C.S.T. Act, which they admittedly were not. Alternatively, it was submitted that section 9(1)(b) had been declared unconstitutional by this Court in the Goodyear case ; and the assessee could seek no implied exemption from its language. Therefore, if section 9 was left out, the language of section 6 ( as amended) which brought to charge all purchases and sales in the State would be attracted and so the impugned taxation of purchases would be in order. Allowing the appeals and the petitions, this Court, HELD: (1) The language of section 9(1)(a)(ii) later section 9(1) (b) using the words \"within the meaning of sub section (1) of section 5 of the \" have to be given full meaning; in other words, the exemption under section 9(1) has to be restricted only to export sales failing within the scope of section 5(1). [360F G] Mohammed Sirajuddin vs State, [1975] Supp. 1 SCR 169, re ferred to. (2) The language of the two provisions simultaneously introduced in section 24(1)(a) and (b) makes interesting reading. The proviso to 345 clause (a) refers only to \"sale by him in the course of export outside the territory of India within the meaning of section 5 of the \" whereas the proviso to clause (b) refers to \"sale by him in the course of export outside the territory of India within the meaning of sub section (3) of section 5 of the \". Thus, the statute, within the same provision, has made a distinction between a sale in the course of export within the meaning of section 5 and such a sale within the meaning of section 5(3). [361C D] (3) The High Court was right in concluding that the assessee was not entitled to the exemption under section 9 because the sales made by him were not sales in the course of export outside the territory of India within the meaning of section 5(1) of the . [362A] (4) What was declared unconstitutional by this Court when it declared section 9(1)(b) of the Act unconstitutional in Goodyear case was only the levy of a tax where raw mate rials were purchased and used inside the State for the manufacture of finished goods which were then simply and without any sale despatched rather, consigned outside the State. There is, however, nothing unconstitutional about the two other consequences that flow on the language of the clause: one express and the other implied; one in favour of the Revenue and the other in favour of the assessee, viz. (1) that there will be a tax on the purchase of the raw materials if the manufactured goods are disposed of in the State itself otherwise than by way of sale; and (2) that there will be no tax on the purchase of the raw materials if the manufactured goods are despatched from the State conse quent on a (i) local sale; (ii) inter State sale; or (iii) a sale in the course of export. These two aspects of section 9(1)(b) survive even after the judgment of this Court in the Goodyear case. [363G H; 364A C] Goodyear, case ; , explained. (5) Section 9(1) is both a charging and exempting sec tion. Even after the decision in Goodyear case the charge under a part of clause (b) still survives and so also the exemption provided in the latter part of clause (b). [364E; C] (6) Since the sales effected by the assessee fail within one of the three exempted categories set out in section 9(1)(b), there can be no levy of purchase tax under section 9(1) of the Sales Tax Act. [363C] (7) The purchase of raw materials by the assessees are not 346 chargeable to tax either under section 9(1)or section 6 or section 24(3). [366G]"

Daulatram Rameshwarlal, claimed exemption from Sales Tax on sales of cotton and castor oil under Article 286(1)(b) of the Indian Constitution, arguing that the goods remained their property until they crossed the customs frontier.\n* The Sales Tax Officer assessed the sellers for sales tax on these goods, and also levied purchase tax under Section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act.\n\n**Key Issues:**\n\n* **Article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution:** This article exempts sales of goods that are \"in course of export\" from tax. The sellers argued that the goods were in \"course of export\" because they remained their property until they crossed the customs frontier.\n* **Section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act:** This section levies purchase tax on goods purchased by a dealer who does not show that the goods were dispatched outside the state of Bombay within six months of purchase. The sellers argued that the \"person\" in this section should be interpreted broadly to include unregistered dealers.\n\n**Court's Decision:**\n\n* The Supreme Court agreed with the Bombay High Court's decision that the goods remained the sellers' property until they crossed the customs frontier. This means the sales were exempt from sales tax under Article 286(1)(b).\n* However, the Court disagreed with the sellers' interpretation of Section 10(b). The Court held that the \"person\" in the section refers to a registered dealer, and that the sellers were liable for purchase tax because they did not demonstrate that the goods were dispatched outside the state of Bombay within the prescribed six-month period.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe Supreme Court dismissed both appeals, upholding the Bombay High Court's decision. The Court emphasized that the intention declared in the certificate under Section 8(b) must be carried out by the registered dealer, and that the Sales Tax Officer's assessment was correct. \n\n\n**Important Legal Concepts:**\n\n* **Article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution:** This article exempts sales of goods that are \"in course of export\" from tax.\n* **Section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act:** This section levies purchase tax on goods purchased by a dealer who does not show that the goods were dispatched outside the state of Bombay within six months of purchase.\n* **\"Course of export\":** This refers to the period when goods are being shipped out of India.\n* **\"Person\" in Section 10(b):** The Court interpreted this to mean a registered dealer. \n\n\nThis case highlights the importance of understanding the specific legal provisions and their interpretation in tax law.",
        "reference": "The respondents firm claimed exemption from Sales Tax under article 286(i)(b) of the Constitution in respect of sales 925 made by them of cotton and castor oil on the ground that the sales were on F.O.B. contracts under which they continued to be the owners of the goods till those crossed the custom barrier and entered the export stream. They also contested the purchase tax to which they were assessed under section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act. The High Court upheld the contention of the respondents regarding the Sales Tax but held that they were liable to pay purchase tax. On appeal by both the parties Held, that the goods remained the seller 's property till those had been brought and loaded on board the ship and so the sales were exempted from tax under article 286(i) of the Constitution. The word \" a person \" in section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act had been correctly interpreted as \" a registered dealer \" and the purchasing dealers had been rightly assessed to purchase tax. The normal rule in F. 0. B. contracts was that the property was intended to pass and did pass on the shipment of the goods. The presumption in F. 0. B. contracts was that it was the duty of the buyer to obtain the necessary export licence, though in the circumstances of a particular case that duty might fall on the seller. H.O. Brandt & Co. vs H.

The case concerned a divorcee seeking maintenance from her former husband. \n\n**Here's a breakdown of the key points:**\n\n**Background:**\n\n* The case involved a divorcee (appellant) who was seeking maintenance from her former husband (respondent).\n* The appellant claimed she was still a wife under the law, despite the divorce, and was entitled to maintenance.\n* The respondent argued that the appellant was a divorced woman and therefore ineligible for maintenance.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n\n* The central issue was whether a divorced woman is entitled to maintenance under Section 125 of the Indian Penal Code (CrPC), which deals with maintenance for destitute women.\n* The court had to interpret the meaning of Section 125 and its applicability to divorced women.\n* The court also had to address the respondent's arguments based on the consent decree of 1962, which settled the marital disputes and included a payment of mehar (dowry).\n\n**Court's Reasoning:**\n\n* The court emphasized the importance of Article 15(3) of the Indian Constitution, which promotes the welfare of women and aims to protect them from social and economic injustice.\n* The court found that the respondent's argument that the divorcee forfeited her claim due to the payment of mehar was flawed.\n* The court held that the payment of mehar, while a customary practice, cannot negate the statutory right of a divorced woman under Section 125.\n* The court emphasized that the purpose of Section 125 is to provide financial support to destitute women, and the payment of mehar should be considered as a substitute for maintenance only if it is sufficient to meet her needs.\n* The court rejected the respondent's argument that the consent decree of 1962 should be used to negate the appellant's right to maintenance.\n* The court concluded that the payment of mehar should be considered in relation to the appellant's actual needs and the court should not interpret the law in a way that would undermine the purpose of Section 125.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* The court allowed the appeal and restored the order of the trial court, granting the appellant maintenance.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The court emphasized the importance of social justice and the need to protect the rights of divorced women.\n* The court interpreted Section 125 in a way that ensures that divorced women are not deprived of their right to maintenance.\n* The court recognized the need for a compassionate and practical approach to interpreting the law, considering the social context and the needs of the parties involved.\n\n\nThis case highlights the importance of interpreting legal provisions in a way that promotes social justice and protects vulnerable groups.

        "reference": "Explanation (b) to section 125(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 provides that \"wife\" includes a woman who has been divorced by or has obtained a divorce from her husband and has not re married. Section 127(3) (b) provides that where any order has been made under section 125 in favour of a woman who has been divorced by or has obtained a divorce from her husband, the Magistrate shall if he is satisfied that the woman has been divorced by her husband and has received, whether before or after the date of the said order, the whole of the sum which under any customary or personal law applicable to the parties, was payable on such divorce cancel such order in the circumstances stated therein. The respondent (husband) married the appellant (wife) and had a son by her. A few years later the respondent divorced his wife. By a consent decree, in the suit filed by the wife, he transferred to her the flat in which she was living and agreed to pay mehar money. The compromise stated that the \"plaintiff declares that she has now no claim or right whatsoever against the defendant\". For some time thereafter they lived together but again separated. The wife moved the magistrate under section 125 Cr.P. for grant of maintenance to her and her son. This was granted. On appeal the Sessions Judge held mat the Court had no jurisdiction under section 125. The High Court dismissed the wife 's appeal. On further appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the respondent that (i) section 125(4) would apply in the absence of proof that the wife was not living separately by mutual consent; (ii) to attract section 125 there must be proof of neglect to maintain the wife and (iii) no claim for maintenance in this case can survive in the face of the consent decree whereby mehar money had been paid and all claims adjusted. Allowing the appeal the Court, G ^ HELD: Every divorcee, otherwise eligible, is entitled to the benefit of maintenance allowance and the dissolution of the marriage makes no difference to this right under the current Code. [78H] 1. There is no force in the argument that the absence of mutual consent to live separately must be made out if the hurdle of section 125(4) is to be overcome. The compulsive conclusion from a divorce by a husband and his provision of a separate residence as evidenced by the consent decree fills the bill. Divorce plainfully implies that the husband orders. the wife out of the conjugal home. [80D] 76 2. The husband 's plea is his right to ignore. So the basic condition of neglect to maintain is satisfied. In this generous jurisdiction the broader perception and appreciation of the facts and their bearing must govern the verdict not chopping little logic or tinkering with burden of proof. [80C] 3. (a) The consent decree resolved all disputes and settled all claims then available. The new statutory right which could not have been in the contemplation of the parties when they entered into the consent decree in 1962 had been created by the Code of 1973. No settlement of claim which does not have the special statutory right of the divorcee under section 125 can operate to negate that claim. [80F] (b) No husband can claim under section 127(3)(b) absolution from his obligation under section 125 towards a divorced wife except on proof of payment of a sum stipulated by customary or personal law whose quantum is more or less sufficient to do duty for maintenance allowance. [81F] (c) Section 127 cannot rescue the husband from his obligation. The scheme of Chapter IX has a social purpose. Ill used wives and desperate divorcees shall not be driven to material and moral dereliction to seek sanctuary in the streets. Where the husband, by customary payment at the time of divorce, has adequately provided for the divorcee. a subsequent series of recurrent doles is contra indicated and the husband liberated. The key note thought is adequacy of payment which will take reasonable care of the wife 's maintenance. [80H] (d) The payment of illusory amounts by way of customary or personal law requirement will be considered in the reduction of maintenance rate but cannot annihilate that rate unless it is a reasonable substitute The legal sanctity of the payment is certified by the fulfilment of the social obligation, not by a ritual exercise rooted in custom. No construction which leads to frustration of the statutory project can secure validation if the Court is to pay true homage to the Constitution. The only just construction of the section is that Parliament intended divorcees should not derive a double benefit If the first payment by way of mehar or ordained by custom has a reasonable relation to the object and is a capitalised substitute for the order under section 125 then section 127(3) (b) subserves the goal and relieves the obligor. not pro tanto but wholly the purpose of the payment \"under any customary or personal law\" must be to obviate destitution of the divorcee and to provide her with wherewithal to maintain herself There must be a rational relation between the cum so paid and its potential as provision for maintenance. [81B C] 4. Welfare laws must be so read as to be effective delivery systems of the salutary objects sought to be served by the Legislature and when the beneficiaries are the weaker sections, like destitute women, the spirit of article 15(3) must belight the meaning of the section. The Constitution is a pervasive omnipresence brooding over the meaning and transforming the values of every measure."

        "reference": "Two separate properties bearing Door Nos. 2 and 3 ad measuring 41 grounds and 2005 sq. ft., which originally formed part of an extent of land, situate at Mount Road, Madras belonged to several co owners, who leased out the same to the Respondent, by two separate lease deeds (exhibit P 1 and P 2) item 1 and 2 in the Schedule A to the plaint. The property contained in Door No. 2 which comprised an area of 4 grounds and 151 sq ft with certain buildings was given on rent for Rs. 150 p.m., whereas the property contained in Door No. 3 which also had some buildings thereon was let out for Rs.200 p.m. The owners sold the properties to the United India Life Assurance Co. and the New Guardian of India Life Insurance Co. Ltd. in July 1953. In 1956, the Life Insurance Corpora tion of India, the appellant stepped into the shoes of the said companies The appellant moved two applications before the Rent Controller for fixation of a 'fair rent ' for each of the premises; In respect of the property in Door No. 2, the rent claimed was Rs.2,399/03 while in respect of the other, the rent claimed was Rs.3266/50p. The tenants claimed that, under both the lease deeds, what had been leased out to them was only a vacant land and since the superstructure had been built by them, they were entitled to relief under the Madras City Tenants ' Protection Act. It was further contended that the Rent Controller had no jurisdiction to fix a fair rent. The Rent Controller accepted the contention of the tenant so far as item No. 1 (property at Door No. 2) was concerned but with regard to the second property (Door No. 3), he fixed the fair rent at Rs. 1451 p.m. There were then two appeals to the Court of Small Causes. The Small Causes Court came to the conclusion that the buildings on the land leased vide P 1 had also been conveyed to the appellant and that the LIC was entitled to seek fixation of fair rent in respect of this premises also. However the order of the Rent Controller in regard to the 546 other property in Door No. 3 was upheld. However, in certain earlier proceedings for fixation of fair rent etc., it had been held by the Rent Controller that item No. (Door No. 2) belonged to the LIC, but his order of eviction had been set aside by the appellate court on some other ground. The Court of Small Causes did not treat that decision as res judicata. The tenants being aggrieved by the order of the Court of Small Causes filed revision petitions but they were dis missed on 20.11.1968. The appellant thereupon filed Civil Suit against the tenants respondents for recovery of arrears of rent together with interests etc. on the basis of the fair rent fixed. The respondents tenants also filed a civil suit claiming protec tion under the Madras City Tenants ' Protection Act but this suit and further appeals therefrom were dismissed. In the suit for recovery of rent filed by the appellant, the ten ants contended that since the subject matter of the lease under exhibit P 1 was only a vacant site, the Rent Controller had no jurisdiction to fix the fair rent in respect thereof and that, therefore, the claim in the suit for arrears of rent, based on the Rent Controller 's order in respect of the premises covered by exhibit P 1 had to fail. The trial Judge in the High Court came to the conclusion that exhibit P 1 did not, in law, create a valid lease between the co owners and the tenants. He further held that the superstructure constructed on the land had been conveyed to the vendee under the sale deed dated 30.7.1953 and thus vested in LIC. On this reason ing the High Court held that the Rent Controller had juris diction to fix the fair rent in respect of the premises. The tenants filed an appeal. The appellate Bench confirmed the decree in respect of Item 2 but as regards Item No. 1, the Appellate Bench vacated the decree passed by the trial Court. It held that there was a valid lease between the owners and the tenants under Exts. P 1 and P 2. The appel lant Bench held that the Rent Controller had no jurisdiction to entertain the application for fixation of fair rent in respect of the property which was only a vacant piece of land. Thus, the Court held that the LIC could not maintain the suit for recovery of rent based on the order made by the statutory tribunal under the Rent Control Act. The tenants ' appeal was accordingly partly allowed. LIC came up in appeal to this Court against the said order, after obtaining special leave. Two questions arose for determination by this Court viz., (1) Was the LIC the vendee only of a vacant land with no title to the buildings standing on the site in Item 1, and (2) it open for the tenants to contend that the order of the Court of Small Causes in the earlier rent 547 control proceedings deciding to the contrary, and fixing the fair rent of item 1 could be completely ignored as an order passed totally without jurisdiction though it had become final between the parties? Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: There are clear indications in the Act and rules that the Rent Controller does not have the jurisdiction to decide questions of title. In a proceeding under the Act, whether it be for fixation of fair rent or eviction, the tenant may raise several objections. He may, inter alia, take the point that the opposite party is not the landlord. [561C D] All that the Rent Controller has to do is to satisfy himself that the person seeking eviction or fixation of fair rent is a 'landlord ' who has, prima facie, the right to receive the rent of the property in question. That the Rent Controller 's jurisdiction on this issue is limited is clear from the proviso to Section 10(1) of the Act. [561 F G] The extensive jurisdiction conferred on civil courts under Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure should not be curtailed without a specific statutory warrant or except on some clear principle. There is nothing in the Tamil Nadu Rent Control Act which, in any way, takes away, or narrows down, the civil court 's jurisdiction as, for example, there is in the Delhi Rent Control Act (Section 50). [569G H] Section 4 of the Rent Control Act provides only a ma chinery for fixation of fair rent in respect of certain premises. It is the quantum of fair rent that arises for determination by the Rent Controller. There is no doubt that, since an application for this purpose cannot lie except at the instance of a landlord or a tenant, the Rent Controller has to deal with this incidentally but this is not one of the direct issues before the Rent Controller. If and only if, this relationship exists between the parties, the Rent Controller steps in for a limited purpose to determine what the fair rent is and then fades out of the picture. Where a fair rent is fixed by a Controller, the Rent Control Act does not provide for a machinery for recov ery of the amount. The amount has to be recovered by the landlord only by recourse to a civil court. This gives an indication that the determination of the relationship that gives rise to the application is also not conclusive. This is indeed made clear by the provisions relating to eviction. [570B E] If the civil court in the instant case, had come to the conclusion that there is a relationship of a landlord and a tenant, and that the LIC 548 was entitled to recover the rent from the tenants, it will have to pass a decree in favour of the LIC on the basis of the fair rent fixed by the Rent Controller. It will not be open to the civil court to re determine the rent payable by the tenant to the landlord because that is a matter squarely and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Rent Control ler and, therefore, impliedly excluded from the purview of the civil court. But his decision is not final on the issue that opens up his jurisdiction and cannot preclude an owner from contending, in a civil court, that he should not be asked to pay rent for his own property to some one else. [570F H] There is no reason to hold that contract between a person with himself and others is invalid.

        "reference": "The petitioners, carrying,on import export of diamonds, field applications for registration as Export Houses and grant of Additional Import Licences under Para 174 and 176 of the Import and Export Policy 1978 79 which were rejected by the authorities on the ground that they have failed to diversify their exports of \"other products\" during the year 1977 78. They challenged the order of the authorities by filing writ petitions before the Bombay High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution. One of the petitions was dismissed by a learned single judge of the High Court and the said petitions filed an appeal before a Division Bench of the High Court. During the pendency of the appeal 233 and the writ petition,the Supreme Court by its order dated April 18, 1985 decided the case of Union of India vs Rajnikant Bros. holding that there was no requirement of diversification of exports as a condition for the grant of Export Houses Certificates in the Import Export Policy for the year 1978 79 but the grantee of Additional Licences were not only prohibited from importing items which were excluded in the Export Policy 1978 79 but also from importing items excluded under the Import Policy prevailing at the time import. The High Court decided the cases of the petitioners in accordance with the decision of this Court in Union of India vs Rajnikant Bros. Purusant to the decision of the Bombay High Court petitioners were granted Export House Certificates and Additional Import Licences which were valid for 12 months, with the same condition as provided by this Court in its order dated April18, 1985 in the case of Rajnikant. However, the petitioners were not able to make imports under the said licences till 31st March,1988.On 1.4.1988, the Government of India issued a revised Export and Import Policy for the period 1988 91.Under Para 215 of the said revised policy certain flexibilities were granted in the matter of imports to the grantees of Additional Import Licences. However, under para 218(10) of the said revised Policy the holdersof the Additional Import Licences issuedprior to 1.4.1988 were made ineligible for the benefit of flexibilities in import as contained in para 215(4). Since ,the petitioners were holding licences issued prior to 1.4.1988 they could not avail the flexibilities in import as contained in Para 215 of the 1988 91 Policy. Consequently, they filed writ petitions in this Court challenging the validity of para218(10) of the 1988 91 Policy contending (i) that all the Export Houses who were granted Additional Licences constitute at single class and their classification on the basis of date or on the basis of period of exports has no connection with the object sought to be achieved by the 1988 91 policy; (ii) that Para 218(10) of 1988 91 Policy arbitrarily discriminates between Export Houses who were issued Additional Licences prior to 1.4.1988 since the benefits ofPara 214 of 1988 91 Policy were conferred only on the latter; (iii) that in view of the judgement of this Court in C.Naveenchandra and Co. vs Union of India, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 989 the petitioners should be treated at par with the grantees of Additional Licences under the Export Policy for the subsequent years and since there has been relaxation in the matter of policy of canalisation of imports under Para 215(4) in respect Additional Licences granted to Export Houses under the 1988 91 Policy, the petitioners were also entitled to a similar relaxation. Dismissing the petitions, this Court, 234 HELD: 1. The right to equality guaranteed under Article 14 ensures equality amongst equals and its aim is to protect persons similarly placed against discriminatory treatment. It means that all persons similarly circumstance shall be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed. Conversely discrimination may result if persons dissimilarily situate are treated equally. Even amongst persons similarly situate differential treatment wouldbe permissible between one class and the other. In that event it is necessary that the differential treatment should be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and that differentia must have a rational relation tothe object sought to be achieved by the statute in question. [242H, 243A B] 2. A close examination of the Import & Export Policy 1978 79 and the Import & Export Policy 1988 91 shows that there is material difference between the conditions for grant of Additional licences under Import Policy 1978 79 and the conditions for grant of such licences under the Import Policy 1988 91. While in the Import & Export policy 1978 79 the emphasis was only on the f.o.b. value of exports without taking into account the outgo of foreign exchange in importing the goods required for achieving the exports by an Export House and Additional licences were granted for a much larger amount at a higher percentage on the basis of the f.o.b.value of the exports, where as in the Import & Export Policy 1988 91 there is a more realistic appraisal of actual benefit to the country ' economy by the exports by taking into account the net foreign exchange earnings after deducting the value of the imports and additional licences are issued on the basis of the net foreign exchange earnings for a much lesser value on a smaller percentage. Therefore, the basis for the grant of Additional Licences which are entitled to relaxation in import under the 1988 91 Policy is different from the basis on which Additional Licences were granted under the 1978 79 policy. [243C, 245B C,248A] 3. The petitioners were not granted Additional Licences on the basis of net foreign exchange earnings and they have secured the Additional Licences on the basis of f.o.b. value of the exports, without taking into account the value of goods imported by them for achieving the exports. It cannot be said that the petitioners who have been granted Additional Licences under the 1978 79 Policy and the Export Houses who were granted Additional Licences under the 1988 91 Policy are persons similarly circumstanced. Therefore the petitioners cannot claim the same facilities that have been provided to Export Houses who are granted Additional Licences under the 1988 91 Policy. Hence they have failed to make out a case for interference by this Court under 235 Article 32 and consequently they cannot assail the validity of Para 218(10) of the Import & Export Policy 1988 91.[245E, 243D, 245F, 249C, 248B] 4. Export Houses, like the petitioners, who were granted Additional Licences on the basis of order of this Court dated April 18, 1985 are not to be treated at par with Export Houses who are granted Additional Licences under the Import & Export Policy prevalent at the time of import. Import of canalised items under Additional Licences issued to the petitioners would be permissible if the import policy prevailing at the time of import permits them to import such items. Therefore the rights of the petitioners under the Additional Licences issued to them would be governed by the terms of the Import Policy prevailing at the time of import.[246A B, 247E, 247H] D.

The case concerns the assessment of the value of fusel oil and styrene monomer manufactured by the appellant, McDowell & Co.

The appellant argues that the packing is not necessary for the manufacture of the goods and should not be included in the value. The Revenue, on the other hand, argues that the packing is an integral part of the manufacturing process and should be included in the value.\n\n**The Arguments:**\n\n* **Appellant's Argument:**\n    * Fusel oil and styrene monomer are manufactured and sold in bulk. \n    * The packing is supplied by the buyer, not the manufacturer.\n    * The goods are marketable without packing.\n    * Section 4(4)(d)(i) of the Act does not contemplate including the cost of packing supplied by the buyer.\n    * The cost of packing is not an incidental or ancillary activity to the manufacture of the goods.\n* **Revenue's Argument:**\n    * Packing is an integral part of the manufacturing process.\n    * The Act does not explicitly exclude the cost of packing supplied by the buyer.\n    * The cost of packing should be included in the assessable value to ensure a fair assessment.\n    * The Revenue argues that the Act should be interpreted in a way that ensures the proper collection of excise duty.\n\n**The Legal Framework:**\n\n* **Section 4(4)(d)(i) of the Act:** This section defines the assessable value of excisable goods. It states that the value includes the cost of packing, except for durable packing that is returnable by the buyer.\n* **Section 2(f) of the Act:** This section defines \"manufacture\" as any process incidental or ancillary to the completion of a manufactured product.\n* **Section 3 of the Act:** This section outlines the levy of excise duty on all excisable goods.\n* **Union of India vs Bombay Tyre International Ltd.:** This case established that the measure of tax should be determined by the terms of the Act and not by the nature of the tax itself.\n\n**The Court's Decision:**\n\nThe Court, in its judgment, will likely consider the following:\n\n* The nature of the goods and their marketability without packing.\n* The intent of the legislature in enacting Section 4(4)(d)(i) of the Act.\n* The interpretation of the term \"manufacture\" under Section 2(f) of the Act.\n* The principle of fairness and consistency in the assessment of excise duty.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Court will likely rule in favor of the appellant, finding that the cost of packing supplied by the buyer is not an integral part of the manufacturing process and should not be included in the assessable value of the goods. \n\n\n**Note:** This is a summary of the legal arguments and the relevant legal provisions.

        "reference": "The appellant company/assessee manufactures and sells fusel oil/ styrene Monomer falling under Tariff Item No. 68 of the 1st Schedule to the . The said fusel oil/styrene Monomer is sold in bulk and generally delivered to the customers at the appellant 's factory in road tankers. Some times it is supplied in drums brought by the customers who are not charged anything for those drums. In the case of Styrene Monomer, the finding is that the supply was in tankers to the extent of 90% and only 10% of the sales were made in drums. Two notices were issued to the appellant to show cause as to why the value of the drums should not be included in the assessable value of the goods. In reply, the appellant contended that as the drums were supplied by the buyer the value thereof could not be included in the assessable value. The Assistant Collector however included the value of the drums in the assessable value of the said fusel oil/Styrene Monomer. The Collector (Appeals) allowed the appellant 's appeal and held that it was not open to the Assistant Col lector to inflate the assessable value without establishing the receipt of the additional consideration by the appellant apart from what had been shown in the invoice. The Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal allowed the further appeal filed by the Revenue and held that at the time of removal the goods were delivered from the factory in packed condition and the containers were not returnable by the buyer, therefore, the value had to be included in the assessable value. Before this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that it was not all packing that was liable to be included under section 4(4)(d)(i) of the Customs and Central Excises Act, it was only that degree of secon 975 dary packing which was necessary for the assessable article to be placed in the condition in which it was sold in the wholesale market at the factory. gate which could be includ ed in the assessable value of the article; fusel oil/Styrene Monomer was sold in bulk and was capable of being so sold, hence it was not necessary for the said fusel oil/Styrene Monomer to be supplied to the customer in drums; the duty of excise was payable on manufactured goods and no duty of excise could be collected from the appellant on such drums which were neither manufactured nor purchased by the appel lant; the duty being on the activity of manufacture whatever was necessary to bring the goods into existence alone could be taken into account for duty purposes; and the sub section did not contemplate the inclusion of the cost of packing in the value of goods when the packing was supplied by a cus tomer to a manufacturer on its own cost. On behalf of the Revenue the learned Attorney General contended that the value of drums/containers would also have to be included on a correct interpretation of charging sections, namely, sections 3 and 4 of the Act; the terms of section 4(4)(d)(i) were very clear and specific; it was a well settled principle of construction that in taxing stat utes one had only to look at what was clearly stated, and there was no room for any intendment; percentages of sales did not in any manner affect determination of the assessable value of the excisable goods; though \"manufacture\" was the taxable event, the measure of the levy need not be and was not to be restricted to the cost of manufacture; it is open to Parliament to prescribe any measure by reference to which the charge was to be levied and this is what was done under section 4; and in construing section 4(4)(d)(i). all that had to be seen was whether the goods were delivered in packed conditions and if this question was answerable in the af firmative, then, in respect of the goods so sold, the cost of packing, whether incurred by the manufacturer or by the supplier, had to be automatically included in the assessable value, if necessary, by addition to the sale price, except only where the packing was of durable nature and returnable to the manufacturer. Allowing the appeals, this Court, HELD: (1) The correct position must be found out bearing in mind the essential nature of excise duty. Excise duty is a duty on the act of manufacture. Manufacture under the excise law is the process of activity which brings into being articles which are known in the market as goods and to be goods these must be different, identifiable and distinct articles known to the market as such. It is then and then only that 976 manufacture takes place attracting duty. [986B] (2) Section 2(f) of the Central Excises & Salt Act provides the definition of the term \"manufacture\". It states, inter alia, that manufacture includes any process incidental or ancillary to the completion of manufactured product. In the instant case, the drums even though these were ancillary or incidental to the supply of fusel oil and styrene monomer, these were not necessary to complete the manufacture of fusel oil or styrene monomer. [983B C, 987D] (3) In order to be 'manufacture ', there must be activity which brings transformation to the article in such a manner that different and distinct article comes into being which is known as such in the market. 'If in order to be able to put it on the market, a certain amount of packing or user of containers or wrappers or putting them either in drums or containers, are required, then the value or the cost of such wrapper or container or drum must be included in the assess able value and if the price at which the goods are sold does not include that value then it must be so included by the very force of the terms of the section. [986C E] (4) The clear implication of the use of the word \"cost\" in relation to packing in the clause (i) of section 4(4)(d) of the Act is that only packing cost of which is incurred by the assessee, i.e. the seller, is to be included. The use of the expression \"cost\" could not obviously be by way of reference to packing for which the cost is incurred by the buyer.

There was no evidence that there was any necessity of packing or putting these in drums prior to their sale, or to be able to generally to enter the stream of wholesale trade or to be marketable. On the other hand, there was evidence that in the wholesale trade, these goods were delivered directly in tankers and deliverable as such. But as a matter of fact, delivery in drums was only to facilitate their transport in small quantities. The manufac ture of the goods was complete before these were placed in drums. The completely manufactured product was stored in tanks. From these tanks the goods were removed directly and placed in vehicles for their movement for 90% of the sales, the vehicle of removal was tankers and for 10% of the sales, the vehicle or removal was drums. In the premises, the value of the drums with regard to the fusel oil/ styrene monomer irrespective of whether these were supplied by the assessee or not. are not includible in the assessable value of the Styrene Monomer. [992A D] Per section Ranganathan, J. (agreeing with the conclusion but resting it entirely on the language of section 4(4)(d)(i) of the Central Excises & Salt Act) (1) There is ample internal indication in the statute to show that the cost of packing referred to in section 4(4)(d)(i) of the Central Excises & Salt Act, 1944 is the cost of packing incurred by the manufacturer and recovered by him from the purchaser whether as part of the said price or separately. [994D] (2) While generally the normal price for which the goods are sold at the factory gate is to be taken as assessable value, an addition thereto has to be made where, in addition to the price, the manufacturer levies a charge for the packing which is intrinsically and inevitably incidental to placing the manufactured goods on the market. [994F] (3) The answer to the question whether the cost of the container should be included in the assessable value or not would depend upon whether the goods in question are supplied in a packed condition or not. If the answer is yes, three kinds of situation may arise. Where the manufacturer sup plies his own container or drum but does not charge the customer therefore, then the price of the goods will also include the cost of the ' container. There will be no ques tion of separate addition to the sale price nor can the assessee claim a deduction of the cost of packing from the sale price except where the container is a durable one 978 and is returnable to the manufacturer. If the manufacturer supplies the drums and charges the customer separately therefore, then, under section 4(4)(d)(i), the cost of the drums to the buyer has to be added to the price except where the packing is of durable nature and is to be returned to the manufacturer. If on the other hand, the manufacturer asks the customer to bring his own container and does not charge anything therefore then the cost (or value) of the packing cannot be \"notionally\" added to, or subtracted from, the price at which the goods have been sold by the manufac turer. [995B D] Per J.S. Verma, J. (agreeing with Ranganathan, J. that the conclusion reached on the language of section 4(4)(d)(i) of the Act is sufficient to allow these appeals). (1) The cost of packing envisaged in section 4(4)(d)(i) of the Act for determining the \"value\" in relation to any excisable goods is only the \"cost of such packing\" incurred by the manufacturer and recovered from the buyer except where the packing is of a durable nature and is returnable by the buyer to the manufacturer. [995G] (2) The \"cost of such packing\" referred to in section 4(4)(d)(i) does not include within its ambit the cost of packing not incurred by the manufacturer when the packing is supplied by the buyer and not the manufacturer.

They also noted that the presumption of bribery under section 4 of the Prevention of Corruption Act was not rebutted.\n* **Appeal Arguments:** Sunderamoorthy appealed, arguing that:\n    * The evidence was insufficient to prove the bribe.\n    * The explanation offered by Sunderamoorthy was plausible and should be considered.\n    * The circumstances of the case were improbable.\n* **Court's Decision:** The Court dismissed the appeal. They found that the prosecution's evidence was strong enough to establish the bribe, and Sunderamoorthy failed to provide sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of bribery.\n\n**Legal Principles:**\n\n* **Presumption of Bribery:** The court emphasized that the presumption of bribery arises when a person receives money that is not due to them as legal remuneration. The burden of proof lies on the accused to rebut this presumption.\n* **Burden of Proof:** The accused must provide evidence that proves their explanation is true and not merely plausible. \n* **Section 4 of the Prevention of Corruption Act:** This section creates a presumption of bribery when a person receives money that is not due to them as legal remuneration.\n\n\n**Outcome:** The appeal was dismissed, upholding the conviction for bribery.",
        "reference": "The appellant was an Accountant cum Headclerk in the Forest Training School, PW 3 the Principal of the training school, and PW I the canteen contractor. The prosecution alleged that on the basis of a complaint made by the appel lant that the food served in the canteen was substandard, PW 3 issued a show cause notice to PW I, as to why the licence for the canteen should not be cancelled and that thereafter the appellant sent for PW I and demanded a bribe of Rs. I00. As the appellant pressed the demand from PW 1, the latter made a complaint to PW 6, the inspector, who arranged a trap. The trap was arranged. PW I handed over the money to the appellant, who received the same. PW 6 conducted the phe nolphthalein test with reference to the fingers of the appellant. The test was positive. The currency notes were seized, and the appellant arrested chargesheeted. The Trial Judge accepted the prosecution evidence, rejected the pleas of the appellant that PW 1 had returned the amount of Rs. 100 due to him, that there had been no demand for a bribe as there had been no occasion for doing so, and recorded conviction. The appellant appealed to the High Court and contended that there was no independent evidence regarding the demand, the messenger who had contacted PW 1 at the behest of the appellant had not been examined, the solitary evidence of PW I is insufficient and that the explanation offered by the appellant was probable and that there is no conclusive evidence to hold that the appellant was guilty. The High Court took the view that the recovery of the currency notes from the appellant prove his guilty conduct, in view of the presumption arising under section 4(1) 01 ' the Prevention of Corruption Act and that the same has not been rebutted and held that though the conviction under 335 section 161 I.P.C. and section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 is to be maintained, no separate sen tence need be awarded under section 161 I.P.C. It, accord ingly, confirmed the conviction of the appellant and sen tenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 15 months. In the appeal to this court, it was contended that the appellant had a consistent case even from the earliest opportunity, that the currency notes found in his possession was the money returned by PW I, and that the presumption, if any, arising under section 4 was rebutted, and the convic tion cannot therefore be sustained. Dismissing the appeal, this Court HELD: 1. The appellant has not even by preponderance of probability succeeded in rebutting the presumption under section 4(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. [338C] 2. The Court has no choice once it is established that the accused person has received a sum of money which was not due to him as a legal remuneration, but to draw a presump tion that the person received the money as a motive of reward. However, it is open to that person to show that though that money was not due to him as legal remuneration, it was legally due to him in some other manner or that he received it under a transaction or an arrangement which was lawful. The explanation offered by the person should be a true one and not one which is merely plausible. [339B C; F] Dhanvantrai Balwantrai Desai vs State of Maharashtra, AIR 1964 SC 575, referred to."

        "reference": "Sub section ( l ) of section 630 of the provides for launching of prosecution against an officer or employee of a company, who (a) wrongfully obtains possession of any property of a company, or (b) having any such property in his possession wrongfully withholds or knowingly misapplies the same. The petitioner who was given a flat by the company for his residence during the period of his employment did not vacate it on his retirement. He was granted six months time on humanitarian grounds upon his undertaking to comply with. Upon his failure to vacate the premises the company lodged a complaint against him under section 630 of the Act for wrongful withholding of its property. The Magistrate took congnizance of the complaint and directed issue of process. Dismissing the writ petition filed by him under article 227 of the Constitution read with section 482 Cr. P.C. seeking to quash the proceedings, the High Court following its consistent view in a series of cases that the term 'officer or employee ' in sub section (1) of section 630 must be interpreted to mean not only the present officer or employee of company but also to include past officers and employees of the company and that the words 'any such property ' in cl. (b) qualify the words 'any property of a company ' appearing in cl. (a), held that the case does not call for interference. 169 In the special leave petition it was contended for the petitioner that the provision contained in section 630 of the Act is a penal provision and, therefore, must be subject to a strict construction and there is no room for intendment, that the term 'officer or employee ' occurring in sub section (1) of section 630 refers only to the existing officers and employees of a company, and not the past officers, and that cl. (b) of sub section (I) does not stand by itself but is interconnected with cl. (a) thereof and therefore cl. (a) and cl. (b) must be read together and when so read the words 'any such property ' in cl. (b) do not qualify the words 'any property of a company ' in cl. (a) and only relate to the property of company wrongfully taken possession of by a present officer. Dismissing the special leave petition, ^ HELD: 1. Section 630 of the plainly makes it an offence if an officer or employee of the company who was permitted to use any property of the company during his employment, wrongfully retains or occupies the same after the termination of his employment. [176F G] 2.1 The term 'officer or employee ' of a company in section 630(1) applies not only to existing officers or employees but also to past officers or employees if such officer or employee either (a) wrongfully obtains possession of any property, or (b) having obtained such property during the course of his employment, withholds the same after the termination of his employment. [179B C] 2.2 The beneficent provision contained in section 630 of the though penal, has been purposely enacted by the legislature with the object of providing a summary procedure for retrieving the property of the company. It is the duty of the Court to place a broad and liberal construction on the provision in furtherance of the object and purpose of the legislation which would suppress the mischief and advance the remedy. [175C E] 2.3 Sub section (1) of section 630 of the Act by clauses (a) and (b) creates two distinct and separate offences: (1) Where an officer or employee of a company wrongfully obtains possession of any property of the company during the course of his employment, to which he is not entitled. Normally, it is only the present officers and employees who can secure possession of any property of a company. It is also possible for such an officer or employee after termination of his employment to wrongfully take away possession of any such property. This is the function of cl. (a) 170 and although it primarily refers to the existing officers and employees, it may also take in past officers and employees. (2) Where an officer or employee of a company having any property of a company in his possession wrongfully withholds it or knowingly applies it to purposes other than those expressed or directed in the articles and authorized by the Act. It may well be that an officer or employee may have lawfully obtained possession of any such property during the course of his employment but wrongfully withholds it after the termination of his employment. That appears to be one of the functions of cl. Clause (b) also makes it an offence if any officer or employee of a company having any property of the company in his possession knowingly applies it to purposes other than those expressed or directed in the articles and authorized by the Act. That would primarily apply to the present officers and employees and may also include past officers and employees. There is therefore no warrant to give a restrictive meaning to the term 'officer or employee ' appearing in sub section (1) of section 630 of the Act. [175F H; 176A C] 3. It is quite evident that clauses (a) and (b) are separated by the word 'or ' and therefore are clearly disjunctive. The whole object of enacting the provision is the preservation of the property of a company by the creation of two distinct offences by clauses (a) and.(b) which arise under different sets of circumstances, and it would be rendered nugatory by projecting cl. (a) into cl. 1176C, D E] 4. According to the plain construction, the words 'any such property ' in cl. (b) relate to 'any property of a company ' as mentioned in cl. It is wrongful with holding of such property meaning the property of the company after termination of the employment, which is an offence under section 630(l)(b) of the Act. [176F; 177E F] 5.

The case revolves around the Shri Vithal Rukhammai Sansthan, an endowment temple in Amalner, India. \n\n**Here's a breakdown of the key points:**\n\n**The Dispute:**\n\n* The appellant (the temple's current owner) argues that the temple is a private endowment, meaning the beneficiaries are specific individuals, not the general public.\n* The respondent (the High Court) and the appellant's legal team disagree, arguing that the temple is a public trust, meaning it benefits the general Hindu public.\n\n**Evidence and Arguments:**\n\n* **The Sanad (1863):** This document grants the temple land to the temple's founder, Sakharam Maharaj, and outlines conditions for its use. The Sanad is considered crucial evidence for the public trust argument.\n* **Varaspatra (1869):** This document appoints a manager to oversee the temple's affairs and outlines the duties of the manager. It is argued that this document supports the public trust argument.\n* **Gifts to the Temple:** Several documents show that the temple has been gifted to the temple's deity and the Sansthan, with the intention of maintaining worship for the benefit of worshippers.\n* **Ramkrishna Deshpande's Testimony:** The temple's constituted attorney, Ramkrishna Deshpande, testifies that the temple is open to the public for darshan and that the temple's purpose is to serve the public.\n* **The High Court's Decision:** The High Court relied on the Sanad and Varaspatra, along with the testimony of Ramkrishna Deshpande, to conclude that the temple is a public trust.\n\n**The Legal Framework:**\n\n* **Public vs. Private Trust:** The court emphasizes the distinction between public and private trusts. Public trusts benefit the general public, while private trusts benefit specific individuals.\n* **Evidence of Public Use:** The court emphasizes that public use of a temple is a strong indicator of its public character.\n* **Founder's Intent:** The court considers the founder's intent when determining the nature of the trust.\n\n**The Court's Decision:**\n\nThe court ultimately agrees with the High Court's decision, finding that the temple is a public trust. The court's reasoning is based on the evidence presented, including the Sanad, Varaspatra, and the testimony of Ramkrishna Deshpande. The court also emphasizes that the temple's purpose is to serve the public, and that the founder's intent was to make the temple accessible to the general public.\n\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The case highlights the importance of considering the founder's intent, the nature of the temple's use, and the evidence of public use when determining whether a temple is a public or private trust.\n* The court's decision emphasizes that the public's right to access and participate in religious activities is a key factor in determining the public character of a temple. \n* The case also underscores the importance of considering the historical context and the evolution of religious institutions. \n\n\nThis summary provides a comprehensive overview of the legal arguments and the court's decision in the case.",
        "reference": "The principles of law for determination of the question whether an endowment is public or private are: (1) In a private trust, the beneficiaries are specific individuals who are ascertained or capable of being ascertained; in a private trust, they are the general public or a class thereof which is incapable of being ascertained. [526C] (2) The intention of the founder as to whether specified individuals or the general public or any specified portion thereof could have the right of worship. [526E] (3) When property is dedicated for the worship of a family idol, it is a private and not a public endowment. Where the beneficiaries are not specified individuals, the endowment can only be regarded as public. [526 F] Devki Nandan vs Murlidhar. ; and State of Bihar & Ors. vs Smt.

[527B] (6) Participation of the members of the public in the darshan in the temple and in the daily acts of worship or in the celebrations on festival occasions may be a very important factor to consider in determining the character of the temple. [527E] Tilkayat Shri Govindlalji Maharaj vs The State of Rajasthan and others, [1964] 1 S.C.R. 561. referred to. (7) The origin of the temple, the manner in which its affairs are managed, the nature and extent of the gifts received by it, rights exercised by the devotees in regard to worship, the consciousness of the manager and the consciousness of the devotees as to the public character of the temple establish whether a temple is a public or a private temple.

(8) It is not always possible to have all the features of a public trust in a given case: even some of the tests may be sufficient to conclude about the character of the trust. [528E] Dismissing the appeal ^ HELD: In the instant case from the documentary and oral evidence the following features are present: (i) The deity installed in the temple was intended by the founder to be continually worshipped by an indeterminate multitude of the Hindu public. (ii) In order to facilitate worship by the public, the founder also intended that regular bhajan, kirtan and worship shall be maintained and annual ceremonies and processions for pilgrimage shall be conducted by the saints in succession nominated by the reigning saint. 519 (iii) There has been no evidence of any hindrance or restriction in the matter of continuous worship by the public extending over a long period. (iv) More than a century ago the temple, in its own name, was the recipient of land by Royal grant and the same has been managed by the saints in succession as manager, not as personal or private property. (v) Gifts of land by members of the public from the Taluka and outside it in favour of the temple or of the Sansthan were made for the purpose of worship. (vi) Collection of subscriptions were made from house to house by taking Maharaj and also for 'Gulal ' ceremony. (vii) Holding out of the Sansthan to all intents and purposes as a public temple. (viii) Treating of the Sansthan by those who are connected with the management as intended for user by the public without restrictions. (ix) Absence of any evidence in the long history of the Sansthan to warrant that it had any appearance of, or that it was ever treated as, a private property. [530E H; 531A B] The above features lead to the inescapable conclusion that Shri Vithal Rukhamai Sansthan is a public trust within the meaning of section 2(13) of the Bombay Public Trust Act."

        "reference": "The assesses carrying on business in the City of Bombay was assessed to income tax for the years 1943 44 to 1947 48 and 1951 52 by the Income tax Officer C 1 Ward Bombay. As the assessee did not pay the income tax due the Income tax Officer issued in April 1951 to the Additional Collector of Bombay a recovery certificate under section 46(2) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922. In February 1954 the Additional Collector issued a notice of demand and as no payment was made he attached the good will and tenancy rights of the assessee 's premises by a warrant of attachment dated 24th March 1954, 888 A sale was held in February 1955. The sale proceeds not being sufficient to satisfy the assessed tax the Additional Collector issued a notice under section 13 of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act, 1876 requiring the assessee to appear before him and show cause why he should not be apprehended and confined to civil prison in satisfaction of the said certified demand. In default of assessee 's appearance and showing cause a warrant for his arrest was issued under section 13 of the Bombay Act, II of 1876 and he was actually arrested on 1st July 1955. An application to the Bombay High Court under article 226 of the Constitution for a writ in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus having proved unsuccessful, an application under article 32 was filed in the Supreme Court for the same relief. Two main points urged on behalf of the assessee were: (a) that section 46(2) of the Indian Income tax Act under which the Income tax Officer issued the recovery certificate to the Additional Collector of Bombay was void, under article 13 (1) of the Constitution in that it offended article 21 and article 14 of the Constitution; (b)that section 13 of the Bombay Land Revenue Act, 1876 (Bombay Act II of 1876) under which the warrant of arrest was issued by the Additional Collector was void under article 13(1) of the Constitution as the same was repugnant to article 14 of the Constitution. Held (as regards a) (1) that there was no violation of fundamental rights under article 21 of the Constitution inasmuch as section 13 of the Bombay Act II of 1876 under which warrant of arrest was issued for the recovery of the demand certified under section 46(2) of the Indian Income tax Act constituted a procedure established by law. Both section 13 of Bombay Act II of 1876 and section 46 of the Indian Income tax Act under which action had been taken against the assessee were not void and therefore no question of violation of funda mental rights under article 21 could arise at all) (ii)the contention that section 46(2) of the Indian Income tax Act provides for two different and alternative methods of recovery of the dues and clothes the Collector with the unfettered and unguided power to apply either of the two methods inasmuch as it enables the Collector at his will to discriminate between two defaulters who are similarly situated and thus violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution was without force because sub section (2) of section 46 does not prescribe two different procedures. The proviso enacted therein does not indicate a different and alternative mode of recovery of the certified amount of tax but only confers additional powers on the Collector for the better and more effective application of the only mode of recovery authorised by the body of sub section (2) of section 46 and therefore there was no question of possibility of dis crimination at all; (iii)the further contention that section 46(2) of the Indian Incometax Act violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution and has thus become void under article 14 of the Constitution as section 46(2) required the Collector,on receipt of the requisite certificate from 889 the Income tax Officer, to recover the amount specified in the certificate as if it were an arrear of the land revenue and there are different laws adopted by different States for the recovery of land revenues and thus there is discrimination on the ground that defaulters are treated differently in different States is also without force be cause discrimination complained of is a permissible classification and does not offend the fundamental right guaranteed by article 14 as the grouping of the income tax defaulters in separate categories on classes State wise is a territorial classification which is based on an intelligible differentia and there is a reasonable nexus or co relation between the basis of classification and the object sought to be achieved by the Income tax Act. The fact that the income tax demand is a Union public demand makes no difference in the legal position. Held, (as regards b) that the contention that section 13 of the Bombay Act II of 1876 became unconstitutional under article 13(1) of the Constitution in that the procedure prescribed by section 13 of the Bombay Act II of 1876 in respect of a defaulter residing in the City of Bombay was harsher and more drastic than the procedure laid down in section 157 of the Bombay Act V of 1879 in respect of a defaulter residing outside the City of Bombay was without force because section 13 of the Bombay Act II of 1876 was amended on 8th October 1954 and a new law laid down a law similar to the law laid down by section 157 of the Bombay Act V of 1879 and thus the vice of unconstitutionality 'if any ' was removed.

The case concerned the legality of the Port Trust's system of work scheduling for shore crew at the Prince's and Victoria Docks, Alexandra Docks, and the Flotilla Crew. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**The Issue:**\n\nThe main issue was whether the Port Trust's system of work scheduling, which included a two-hour rest period and two-hour overtime, violated the provisions of the Indian Minimum Wages Act, 1948. The Union argued that this system was unfair and violated the workers' right to a minimum wage and a fair work schedule.\n\n**The Court's Reasoning:**\n\nThe Court analyzed the relevant provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, and the rules made under it. It found that:\n\n* **The Act and Rules do not mandate a specific break-up of work hours into intervals of rest.** The Act and Rules only require that the total work hours in a week should not exceed 48 hours, and that workers should have a minimum of half an hour rest break after every 5 hours of work.\n* **The Port Trust has the flexibility to arrange work hours and rest periods according to the nature of the work.** The Court acknowledged that the nature of work at the docks, particularly the tidal nature of the work, makes it difficult to fix a fixed rest period.\n* **The Port Trust's system of variable rest periods is not a breach of the Act.** The Court found that the Port Trust's system of variable rest periods, where the rest period is specified in advance, is not a violation of the Act.\n* **The comparison with other dock crews is not relevant.** The Court rejected the Union's argument that the Prince's and Victoria Docks crew should be treated the same as the Flotilla Crew or the Alexandra Docks crew. The nature of work and the specific conditions at each dock are different, making a direct comparison inappropriate.\n\n**The Court's Decision:**\n\nThe Court upheld the Port Trust's system of work scheduling, finding that it was not in violation of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948. The Court emphasized that the Port Trust had the flexibility to arrange work hours and rest periods according to the specific needs of the docks.\n\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The case highlights the importance of considering the specific circumstances of each work environment when interpreting labor laws.\n* The Court emphasized the need for flexibility in work scheduling, especially in industries like docks where work is subject to external factors like tides.\n* The case also underscores the importance of considering the nature of work and the specific conditions of each work environment when interpreting labor laws. \n\n\nThis summary provides a concise overview of the legal arguments and the Court's decision in the *Bombay Port Trust v. The Bombay Port Trust Employees' Union* case.",
        "reference": "The respondent had under its control several docks. The trustees Of the respondent introduced a two shift system of work and that resulted in the crew working in some docks getting 4 hours of overtime in some docks 3 hours of overtime and in others 2 hours of overtime only. In the last category the 12 hours shift wag divided in to 8 hours of work, 2 hours of rest and 2 hours of overtime. The 2 hours period of rest was variable depending on the tides or the exigencies of the work, though the crew were informed each day what the, period of rest would be on the following day. The appellants, who belonged to this category, complained that the breakup of the 12 hours shift into 8 hours of duty, 2 hours of rest and 2 hours of overtime offended the , and that the system of variable recess did not satisfy the requirements of rest which is the basis for fixing statutorily the hours of work in relation to wages. The Industrial Tribunal held that the appellants were not able to establish that the existing system of work needed any modification. In appeal to this Court, HELD: There was no breach of the provision of the and the case of the appellants could not be compared with that of the crew working at the other docks, because, there wag no parallel in the work of the three different sets of crew. [643 H] If an employer takes actual work for 8 hours per day on 6 days in a week he complies with the relevant provisions of the Act and the Rules, namely sections 13 and 14 of the Act and rr. 24 and 25 of the Minimum Wages (Central) Rules 1950, and need not pay overtime. He may go up to 9 hours on any day without paying any overtime provided he does not exceed 48 hours in the week. He can specify the intervals of rest and spread the 8 or 9 hours, as the case may be, together with intervals of rest over 12 hours in a twelve hour shift. These periods of rest must not be periods during which the workman is on duty and inaction is due to want of work for him, but they must be predetermined periods of inaction during which the workman is neither called upon nor expected to display physical activity or sustained attention.[641 B D] In the present cage the total number of hours of work in a week was 48 (8 hours per day for 6 days). Therefore overtime was payable beyond the period of 8 hours, for that hour or part of an hour during which the workman was either made to work or the interval of rest was not specified. The respondent can say that it will not take more that two hours extra work on any day and specify the remaining two hours as the intervals for rest; and the Trustees would not be guilty of infraction of the Act by keeping the recess variable so long as they specify 633 in advance the recess on any particular day. The Trustees could not be compelled to break up the hours of work by interposing intervals for rest. [641 G H; 643 B C, D E]"

        "reference": "In June 1948 the appellant instituted a suit against the first respondent and others for their ejectment from the property in suit, On February 28, 1949 the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act came into force. The first respondent was not a thika tenant within the definition therefore of given in the Act. The suit was decreed by the Munsif in March 1949. In November 1949 the appeal filed by the first respondent was ,dismissed by the first appellate court. He then filed a second ,,appeal in the High Court which was heard in 1954. Before that the Calcutta Thika Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 1953 was passed. Under this Act the first respondent came within the definition of thika tenant. The High Court remanded the case to the Subordinate Judge for trying the case in the light of the amended Act. The Subordinate Judge held that the first respondent was a thika tenant and could not be ejected as none of the grounds mentioned in section 3 of the Act had been established by the appellant. The latter appealed to the High Court and urged that with the omission of section 29 in the 1953 Act Civil Courts became, unable to remit ejectment suits to the Rent Controller with the result that the Act as amended could not apply to pre Act suits. The High Court however took the view that after the omission of sections 28 and 29 from the Act suits for eviction before civil courts became infructuous and, accordingly, dismissed the appeal. The appellant with certificate came to this Court. The questions that fell for consideration were: (i) whether the tenant could take the benefit of section 3 in a pre Act suit, (ii) whether in view of the omission of sections 28 and 29 from the Act the civil courts had jurisdiction to try such a suit. HELD:Per Wanchoo C.J. & Mitter J. (i) While it is a general principle of law that statutes are not to operate retrospectively so as to defeat vested interests; such operation may be given by express enactment or by necessary implication from the language employed. The language of section 3 leaves no room for doubt that it is retrospective since it expressly states that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any contract, a thika tenant will be liable to ejectment on grounds specified therein and not otherwise. [179 D E; 180 F G]. Knight vs Lee, and Beadling vs Goll, 39 Times Law Reporter 31, referred to. Section 3 does not purport to lay down that the grounds mentioned therein have got to be stated in the notice of ejectment. All that the section lays down is that ejectment could not be had unless the ,existence of one of the grounds was proved. Such proof could have been adduced at the trial even if no mention of the grounds had been made before. The appellant not having given such proof the case was rightly decided against him. [183 C D]. 171 (ii) However In a pre Act suit no notice under section 4 could be insisted on as that section , clearly prospective. Section 5 which required proceedings to be filed before the Controller was also clearly prospective. [180 H; 181 A; B H]. (iii) The High Court was wrong in holding, that suits for the eviction of thika tenants became infructious before civil courts after the omission of sections 28 and 29. There being no longer any provision for transfer of pending suits and appeals, the court hearing the appeal would have to pass a decree for ejectment even if the defendant was a thika tenant after taking into account section 3. [183 D F]. Per Bhargava, J. This appeal must be dismissed because the respondent was entitled to the benefit of section 3. It was not necessary to express any opinion whether compliance With section 4 was also required or whether it being prospective only no such compliance by the appellant was needed. [184 B]."

Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**Background:**\n\n* **Bench Secretaries:** These are administrative officers in the Allahabad High Court, responsible for supporting the judicial process.\n* **Pay Scales:**  Initially, Bench Secretaries were paid higher than Section Officers (similarly positioned administrative staff in the Secretariat).\n* **Pay Rationalization:**  In 1965, the State Government appointed a Pay Rationalization Committee, which recommended a pay scale reduction for Bench Secretaries. This was accepted, but Bench Secretaries continued to be paid more than Section Officers.\n* **Further Disputes:**  Bench Secretaries continued to argue for equal pay with Section Officers, claiming they were a \"superior class\" and deserved higher pay.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n\n* **Equal Pay for Equal Work:** The core issue is whether it's constitutional to have two pay scales for the same or similar work within the same cadre. The High Court is asked to decide if this violates the right to \"equal pay for equal work\" guaranteed by the Constitution.\n* **Classification and Justification:** The Court must determine if the pay scale differentiation is justified. The State Government argues that the pay scales are based on duties and responsibilities, which are different for Bench Secretaries and Section Officers.\n\n**Court's Reasoning:**\n\n* **Equal Pay is a Constitutional Goal:** The Court agrees that \"equal pay for equal work\" is a constitutional goal, but it's not a fundamental right.\n* **Classification is Possible:** The Court acknowledges that there can be different grades within a service, especially if there are different qualifications for entry into each grade.\n* **Reasonableness is Key:** The Court emphasizes that the classification must be based on \"reasonable grounds\" and not arbitrary.\n* **Randhir Singh Case:** The Court cites the Randhir Singh case, where a driver constable in the Delhi Police Force was awarded equal pay with other drivers in the Delhi Police Force, even though they performed similar duties.\n* **P. Savita Case:** The Court also cites the P. Savita case, where the pay scales for senior draftsmen in the Ministry of Defence Production were found to be arbitrary and discriminatory.\n\n**The Appeal:**\n\n* **State of U.P. Appeal:** The State of U.P. is appealing the High Court's decision to quash the pay scale differentiation for Bench Secretaries. They argue that the High Court erred in its interpretation of the Constitution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe case is complex and involves a balance between the right to equal pay and the need for reasonable classification within a service. The Court will need to weigh the arguments of both sides and determine if the pay scale differentiation is justified. \n\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The case highlights the importance of \"equal pay for equal work\" in the context of the Indian Constitution.\n* The Court will need to balance the right to equal pay with the need for reasonable classification within a service.\n* The Court will consider the specific duties and responsibilities of each position and the qualifications required for each grade.",
        "reference": "Prior to 1955, the Bench Secretaries in the Allahabad High Court were on a higher pay scale than that of the Section Officers. In 1965, the State Government appointed a Pay Rationalisation Committee to consider the duties and responsibilities of different categories of posts and recommend changes. The Committee recommended for the Bench Secretaries a pay scale lower than that of the Section Officers. The Bench Secretaries made a representation to the Government that they be put at par with the Section Officers if not on a higher scale. The Government appointed Pay Commission (l971 72). The Pay Commission did not accept the claim of the Bench Secretaries. The Bench Secretaries again moved the Government reiterating their demand, whereupon an \"Anomalies Committee\" was constituted. The Committee rejected the claim of the Bench Secretaries for placing them at par with the Section Officers, but suggested that ten posts of Bench Secretaries be upgraded. The Government accepted the recommendation and issued orders upgrading ten posts of Bench Secretaries to be called Bench Secretaries grade I, giving the nomenclature of Bench Secretaries grade Il to the rest of Secretaries. The Bench Secretaries grade II moved the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, challenging the bifurcation of their cadre into grade I & grade 11. The High Court quashed the notification which created Bench Secretaries grade 1. The State of l, '.P., aggrieved by the decision of the High Court, appealed to this Court. PG NO 288 PG NO 289 Two questions arose for consideration (i) whether the Bench Secretaries were entitled to pay scales admissible to Section officers, and (11) whether the creation of two grades with different pay scales in the cadre of Bench Secretaries doing the same or similar work was violative of the \"equal pay for equal work\". Allowing the appeal, the Court, HELD:(I) It requires of duties and responsibilities of the respective posts. Functions of two posts may appear to be the same or similar, but there may be a difference in the performance. Quantity of work may be the same but quality may be different. The equation of posts of equation of pay must be determined by expert bodies, like pay commissions. If there is any determination by a Commission or Committee, the Court should normally accept it and not tinker with it unless it is shown to be made with extraneous consideration. [298G H;299A B] The Bench Secretaries were paid more emoluments than the section Officers, but it was not known on what basis and how they were treated superior to Section Officers. The Successive Pay Commission and the Pay Rationalisation Committee found no support to their superior claim. The Court could not go against that opinion. The Bench Secretaries could as of right the pay scale admissible to the Section Officers. [299C D] (2) The second question formulated affected the civil services in general. All the Bench Secretaries concerned were indisputably having the same duties. They had been bifurcated into two grades with different pay scales grade I with higher pay scale and grade II which was said to offend the constitutional principle of \"equal pay for equal work\". [299E G] Article 39(d) of the Constitution, which proclaims \"equal pay for equal work\" and other like provisions in the Directive Principles, are rooted in Social Justice, intended to bring about a socio economic trans formation in society. In matters of employment, it must be ensured that there is no exploitation of the poor and ignorant. It is the duty of the State to see that the under privileged or weaker section get their dues. Against this background the principle of \"equal pay for equal work\" has to be construed. This principle has no mechanical application in every ca8e of similar work. It has to be read into Article 14 of the Constitution, which permits reasonable classification founded on different basis. [303C E] PG NO 290 The classification can be based on some qualities or characteristics of persons grouped together and not in others left out. Those qualities or characteristics must have a reasonable relation to the object to be achieved. In service matters, merit or experience could be the proper basis for classification to promote efficiency. It cannot be denied that the quality of work performed by persons of longer experience is Superior to the work of new comers. Higher pay scale to avoid stagnation or resultant frustration for lack of promotional evenues is common in career service. Entitlement to higher pay scales depends upon seniority cum merit or merit cum seniority. The differentiation so made in the same cadre will not amount to discrimination. Classification based on experience is a reasonable classification having a rational nexus with the object thereof. To hold otherwise, would be detrimental to the interest of the Service itself. [303F H; 304A B] The Bench Secretaries might do the same work, but their quality of work might differ. The Rule framed by the Chief Justice of the High Court make a proper classification for the purpose of entitlement to higher pay scale. The High Court overlooked the criterion provided under the Rules. Merit governs the grant of higher pay scale. Classification made under the Rules could not be said to be violative of the right to have equal pay for equal work.

Special Area Development Authority, Korba*. The case concerns the legality of property tax levied by the Special Area Development Authority (SADA) on companies owned by the Government of India. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**Background:**\n\n* **The Case:** The case involves three companies (Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd., Western Coalfields Ltd., and Jammu and Kashmir State Agro Industries Corporation Ltd.) that are wholly owned by the Government of India. They are being taxed for property tax by the SADA, Korba.\n* **The Issue:** The core legal question is whether the SADA has the power to levy property tax on these companies, given that they are owned by the Government of India. \n* **The Arguments:** The Attorney General for the appellants (the companies) argues that the SADA's power to levy property tax is limited to the powers of a Municipal Corporation or Municipal Council as defined in the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956, and the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1961. He argues that the SADA's power to levy property tax is derived from these earlier Acts, and that amendments made to these Acts after the enactment of the Act of 1973 do not apply to the SADA's power.\n* **The SADA's Argument:** The SADA argues that the Act of 1973, which created the SADA, empowers it to levy property tax on the companies, and that the amendments to the Municipal Corporation Act and Municipalities Act do not affect this power.\n\n**Key Legal Arguments:**\n\n* **Incorporation vs. Reference:** The Attorney General argues that the Act of 1973 does not incorporate the provisions of the earlier Municipal Acts, but merely refers to them. He argues that the SADA's power to levy property tax is derived from the earlier Acts, and that the amendments to those Acts do not affect the SADA's power.\n* **Taxing Authority's Discretion:** The Attorney General argues that the SADA has the discretion to determine whether to tax the land or the building, and that the SADA's power to levy property tax is not limited by the procedures prescribed in the Municipal Acts.\n* **Government Ownership vs. Corporate Personality:** The Attorney General argues that the Government of India owns the share capital of the companies, but not the companies themselves. He argues that the companies have a separate corporate personality and that the Government of India only owns the share capital.\n\n**The Court's Decision:**\n\nThe Supreme Court of India has dismissed the Attorney General's arguments. The Court found that the SADA has the power to levy property tax on the companies, and that the amendments to the Municipal Acts do not affect this power. The Court also found that the SADA has the discretion to determine whether to tax the land or the building, and that the SADA's power to levy property tax is not limited by the procedures prescribed in the Municipal Acts.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Supreme Court of India has ruled in favor of the SADA, finding that the SADA has the power to levy property tax on the companies. The Court's decision is significant because it clarifies the SADA's power to levy property tax and sets a precedent for future cases involving similar issues.",
        "reference": "The Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1961 by section 127 (1) (i) empowered a municipal council to impose, in the whole or any part of the municipality, \"a tax payable by the owners of houses, buildings or lands situated within the limits of Municipality with reference to annual letting value of the house, building or land called property tax\". The corresponding provision in the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 was section 132(1)(a), and it provided that \"the Corporation shall impose a tax payable by the owners of buildings or lands situated within the city with reference to the gross annual letting value of the building or land called the property tax\". The procedure for imposition of taxes was spelt out in section 129 of the Municipalities Act and section 133 of the Municipal Corporation Act. Section 127A was inserted in the Municipalities Act for imposition of property tax and provided by sub clause (1) that as and from the financial year 1976 77 there shall be charged, levied and paid for each financial year a tax on the lands or buildings or both situated in a municipality at specified rates. Sub clause (2) exempted properties owned by or vesting in the Union Government, State Government or the Council from the levy. Similar 2 provisions were inserted in sections 135 and 136 of the Municipal Corporation Act. Respondent No. 1 was constituted the Special Area Development Authority under section 65 of the Madhya Pradesh Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh Adhiniyam (23 of 1973). Clauses (c) and (d) of section 69 of the Act conferred upon the Development Authority powers for the purpose of municipal administration and for the purpose of taxation. These clauses were inserted by Ordinance 26 of 1975 which came into force on February 27, 1976. The Ordinance was replaced by the Madhya Pradesh Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh (Sanshodhan) Adhiniyam 1976 (6 of 1976). On June 24, 1976 respondent 1 entered into an agreement with the appellant company under which the company agreed to contribute a sum of rupees 3 lakhs annually to the \"seed capital\" of the Authority in consideration of the Authority agreeing not to exercise its power of taxation or of levying any other charges on the assets and activities of the company. The agreement was to remain in force for a period of ten years beginning from the calendar year 1976 and the annual payments due from 1977 were to be made in January every year. The appellant company paid the contribution for the year 1976. In the same year the company was called upon by the Sales Tax authorities to pay \"the tax on the entry of goods\" which was introduced by the Madhya Pradesh Sthaniya Kshetra Me Mal Ke Pravesh Par Kar Adhyadesh 1976 in substitution of octroi tax. While the company was pursuing that matter with the State Government, contending that it was not liable to pay the entry tax by reason of the agreement, on January 4, 1977 respondent 1 made a further demand of Rs. 3 lakhs on the company for contribution for the year 1977. That amount not having been paid as provided in the agreement, respondent 1 terminated the agreement by its letter dated February 4, 1977. By a notice issued under section 65 of the Madhya Pradesh Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh Adhiniyam 'Act of 1973 ' on February 21, 1977 and by another notice issued under section 164(3) of the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act 1961 on April 15, 1977, the Chief Executive Officer of respondent 1 called upon the company to pay a sum of about Rs. 13 lakhs by way of property tax for the year 1976 77. On July 16, 1977 the company was called upon to pay a further sum of about Rs. 13 lakhs as property tax for the year 1977 78. The company disputed its liability to pay on the ground that no tax was leviable on its property since the company was owned wholly by the Government of India and that respondent 1 was estopped from levying the property tax by reason of the agreement of 1976. Having failed to pursuade respondent 1 to accept its point of view, and also having failed in the High Court the appellant company came to this Court in appeal. In the appeals to this Court it was contended: (1) that respondent 1 can exercise only such powers to levy property tax as the Municipal Corporation or the Municipal Council had under the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 or the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1961 as these Acts stood on February 27, 1976, when clause (d) was inserted in section 69 of the Act of 1973. Section 127A and section 135 which create and levy the charge of property 3 tax having been inserted in the Municipalities Act and the Municipal Corporation Act respectively with effect from April 1, 1976 i.e. subsequent to the insertion of clause (d) in section 69 of the Act of 1973, Respondent 1 was incompetent to exercise the powers of the Municipality or the Municipal Corporation under section 127A of the Municipal Corporation Act or section 136 of the Municipal Corporation Act; (2) that respondent 1 cannot impose the property tax without following the procedure prescribed by section 129 of the Municipalities Act and section 133 of the Municipal Corporation Act; (3) that Article 285(1) of the Constitution envisages that the property of the Union shall save in so far as Parliament may by law otherwise provide be exempt from all taxes imposed by a State or by any authority within a State. Section 127A(2) of the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act and section 136 of the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act also provide that the property tax shall not be leviable, on \"buildings and lands owned by or vesting in the Union Government\". The appellant companies being wholly owned by the Government of India, the lands and buildings owned by the companies cannot be subjected to property tax; (4) that the lands having been taken on lease for a period of 30 years by the appellant companies, it is the State Government and not the appellant companies who can be called upon to pay the tax; and (5) that Parliament enacted the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act, 1973 for acquisition of coal mines and utilisation of coal resources to subserve the common good. The lands and buildings on which respondent 1 had imposed the property tax are used for the purposes of and are covered by coal mines. The taxing power of the State legislature comes in conflict with the power and function of the Union to regulate and develop the mines as envisaged by the Nationalisation Act, and is an impediment since it substantially increased the cost of the developmental activities. Dismissing the appeals, ^ HELD: (i) Section 69(d) of the Act of 1973 must be read to mean that respondent 1 shall have all the powers of taxation which a Municipal Corporation or a Municipal Council has at the time when respondent 1 seeks to exercise those powers. [14 A] (ii) The Act of 1973 does not provide for any independent power of taxation or any machinery of its own for exercising the power of taxation. It rests content by referring to the provisions contained in the two Municipal Acts. The three Acts are supplemental, from which it must follow that amendments made to the earlier Acts after the enactment of section 69(d) shall have to be read into that section. Without recourse to such a construction the power of taxation conferred by that section will become ineffectual. [14 B C] (iii) A reading of the reference to the two earlier Municipal Acts as a reference to those Acts as they stand at the time when the power of taxation is sought to be exercised by respondent 1 will not cause repugnancy between the two earlier Acts on one hand and the Act of 1973 on the other, nor will it cause any confusion in the practical application of the earlier Acts, because the Act of 1973 does not contain any independent provision or machinery for exercising the power of taxation. [14 D] 4 (iv) If an earlier legislation is incorporated into a later legislation, the provisions of earlier law which are incorporated into the later law become a part and parcel of the later law. Therefore, amendments made in the earlier law after the date of incorporation cannot by their own force, be read into the later law. That is because the legislature, cannot be assumed to intend to bind itself to all future amendments or modifications which may be made in the earlier law. [12 D E] (v) Where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute by a third does not affect the second. Likewise, where certain provisions from an existing Act have been incorporated into a subsequent Act, no addition to the former Act, which is not expressly made applicable to the subsequent Act, can be deemed to be incorporated in it. [12G 13A] (vi) The broad principle that where a subsequent Act incorporates provisions of a previous Act then the borrowed provisions become an integral and independent part of the subsequent Act and are totally unaffected by any repeal or amendment in the previous Act, is subject to four exceptions, one of which is that the principle will not apply to cases \"where the subsequent Act and the previous Act are supplemental to each other\".

Narasimhan, ; , referred to. In the instant case, subsequent amendments made to the Municipal Corporation Act and the Municipalities Act will also apply to the power of taxation provided for in section 69(d) of the Act of 1973. The Act of 1973 did not by section 69(d), incorporate in its true signification any particular provision of the two earlier Acts. It provided that, for the purpose of taxation, the Special Area Development Authority shall have the powers which a Municipal Corporation or a Municipal Council has under the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 or the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1961. The case, therefore, is not one of incorporation but of mere reference to the powers conferred by the earlier Acts. [13 E F] 2(i) Section 127A of the Municipalities Act and section 135 of the Municipal Corporation Act create by their own force, the liability to be brought to property tax and the right to levy that tax. Nothing further is required to be done by the Municipality or the Municipal Corporation in order to impose the property tax. The procedure preliminary to the imposition of other taxes which is prescribed by sections 129 and 133 of the two Acts, can have no application to the imposition of the property tax. [14 F 15 A] (ii) The property tax is imposed by respondent 1 under section 127A of the Municipalities Act and section 135 of the Municipal Corporation Act. It is not imposed under section 127 of the former Act or section 132 of the latter Act. It is, therefore, not necessary to follow the procedure prescribed by sections 129 and 133 of the respective Acts. [15 B C] 5 3. Even though the entire share capital of the appellant companies has been subscribed by the Government of India, it cannot be predicated that the companies themselves are owned by the Government of India. The companies, which are incorporated under the Companies Act, have a corporate personality of their own, distinct from that of the Government of India. The lands and buildings, are vested in and owned by the companies; the Government of India only owns the share capital.

The Explanation to section 147 of the Municipalities Act says that the property tax has to be paid by the owner of the land or building and that a tenant of land or building or both, who holds the same under a lease for an agreed period, shall be deemed to be the owner thereof. Section 141(1) of the Municipal Corporation Act provides that the property tax shall be paid primarily by the owner. By sub section (2) of section 141, the property tax levied on the owner can also be recovered from the occupier of the land or the building.[18D E] 5(i) The power conferred by the State Legislature on Special Area Development Authorities to impose the property tax on lands and buildings is not in conflict with the power conferred by the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act on the Union Government to regulate and develop coal mines so as to ensure rational and scientific utilisation of coal resources. [21 G] (ii) The paramount purpose behind the declaration contained in section 2 of the is not in any manner defeated by the legitimate exercise of taxing power under section 69(d) of the Act of 1973.

        "generated": "This legal document is a summary of the judgment of the Indian Supreme Court in the case of *Civil Appeals Nos. 188 to 190 of 1958*. The case concerns the termination of a leasehold right granted by the Rajah of Venkatagiri to the appellant, who was a lessee of slate quarries. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**Background:**\n\n* The Rajah of Venkatagiri granted a lease to the appellant for slate quarries in 1942.\n* The Abolition of Estates Act, 1948 (Abolition Act) was enacted to abolish the traditional land tenure system in the Madras Presidency.\n* The Abolition Act provided for the transfer of land to the Government and the validity of certain rights created before the notification date.\n* The appellant's lease was granted after July 1, 1945, and exceeded one year.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n\n* The main issue was whether the Government could terminate the lease under the Abolition Act, specifically under the second proviso of section 20.\n* The appellant argued that the second proviso only applied to rights created before July 1, 1945, and that the third proviso was necessary to allow termination of rights created after that date.\n* The Government argued that the second proviso made rights created after July 1, 1945, unenforceable against the Government, and that the third proviso was not necessary.\n\n**Court's Decision:**\n\n* The Court rejected the appellant's argument that the third proviso was necessary for termination of rights created after July 1, 1945.\n* The Court found that the second proviso, which makes rights created after July 1, 1945, unenforceable against the Government, was sufficient to achieve the desired outcome.\n* The Court also rejected the appellant's argument that the Government should have allowed his application for lease renewal under the Mineral Concession Rules.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The Court reasoned that the Abolition Act was enacted to abolish traditional land tenure and that the second proviso was intended to nullify the creation of rights in anticipation of the legislation.\n* The Court found that the second proviso was a self-contained provision and did not require the third proviso to be invoked for termination.\n* The Court also found that the third proviso was intended to apply only to rights created before July 1, 1945.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* The Court dismissed the appeals and ordered the appellant to pay costs.\n\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The Court emphasized the importance of the Abolition Act in abolishing traditional land tenure and the need to interpret the Act in light of its purpose.\n* The Court found that the second proviso of section 20 of the Abolition Act was sufficient to achieve the desired outcome of terminating rights created after July 1, 1945.\n* The Court rejected the appellant's argument that the third proviso was necessary for termination of rights created after July 1, 1945.",
        "reference": "The principal question for determination in these appeals, arising out of writ petitions filed in the High Court, related to the validity of an order passed by the Board of Revenue (Andhra) terminating the appellant 's lease in respect of certain state quarries situated in the Venkatagiri Estate, which had been notified under section 3 of the Madras Estate (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948 (Mad. XXVI Of I948), under the second proviso to section 20(1) of the Act, on the finding that the said lease was granted subsequent to July I, 1945, and was for a period exceeding one year, without giving the appellant three months ' notice under the third proviso to that section or providing for compensation under sub section (2) thereof. The appellant had also claimed renewal of. , the lease under r. 47 Of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1949, which was rejected by the Board as well as by the High Court. The contention on behalf of the appellant, in substance, was that the words \"such right\" in the third proviso to section 20(1) referred to the right mentioned in the second proviso, namely, the right created on or after July 1, 1945, and thus made applicable to it the provision of sub section (2)of the section, and before such right could be terminated the provisions of the third proviso relating to notice and sub section (2) as to compensation had to be complied with. Held, that the contention raised on behalf of the appellant was without substance and must be negatived. The scheme of the Act was to render all rights created after July 1, 1945, and for a period exceeding one year, ineffective and section 20, properly construed, made it amply clear that its second proviso was a self contained provision that rendered such rights void against the Government and, even if they were voidable and not void, the aid of the third proviso was wholly uncalled for. The third proviso must be held to refer solely to termination of rights created before July i, 1945. A. M. section section V. M. & Co. vs The State of Madras, I.L.R. , referred to. 553 The rule framed by the Madras Governor in exercise of the powers conferred on him by section 67(6) and (2) of the Act could not attract the operation of the third proviso nor could it change the true meaning Of section 20 Of the Act. Held, further, that r. 47 Of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1949, which could at best insert a few terms in the lease, could not apply to a case, such as the present one, where the lease itself stood determined under the second proviso Of section 20 of the Act and its terms fell with it."
